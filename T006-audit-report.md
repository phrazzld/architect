# Audit Report: Logger Calls for Secret Leaks in Registry

## Summary
After reviewing all logger calls in the `internal/registry/*` files, I found no instances where API keys or other sensitive information are directly logged. The logger calls in this package primarily log operational information, error messages, and configuration details without exposing any secrets.

## Methodology
1. Identified all files in the `internal/registry/` directory
2. Used grep to search for all logger calls (Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal)
3. Examined each logger call to identify what data is being logged
4. Checked for any variables that might contain sensitive data
5. Verified that no API keys, tokens, or credentials are logged

## Findings

### Files Reviewed
1. `/Users/phaedrus/Development/architect/internal/registry/manager.go`
2. `/Users/phaedrus/Development/architect/internal/registry/registry.go`
3. `/Users/phaedrus/Development/architect/internal/registry/registry_token_precedence_test.go`

#### registry.go
- Line 48, 58, 63, 64, 71, 78: Logs info about loading configuration - No sensitive data
- Line 66-67: Logs provider info - Intentionally avoids logging full base URL by using the helper function `getBaseURLLogSuffix`
- Line 74-75: Logs model registration - No sensitive data
- Line 111-112: Logs largest context window model - No sensitive data
- Line 122: Logs provider model counts - No sensitive data
- Line 132: Logs model lookup - No sensitive data
- Line 136-137: Logs warning when model not found - No sensitive data
- Line 141-142: Logs found model details - No sensitive data
- Line 146-147, 150-151, 156-157: Logs warnings about invalid token limits - No sensitive data
- Line 190: Logs provider lookup - No sensitive data
- Line 194-195: Logs warning when provider not found - No sensitive data
- Line 204: Logs found provider details - **Carefully handles base URL** by using a conditional to avoid logging actual URL
- Line 237: Logs provider implementation registration - No sensitive data
- Line 258: Logs creating LLM client for model - Contains only model name, no sensitive data
- Line 262: Logs error for empty API key - **Properly handles API key** by only logging that it was empty without revealing the key itself
- Line 267: Logs retrieving model definition - No sensitive data
- Line 275: Logs token limits for model - No sensitive data
- Line 280: Logs retrieving provider definition - No sensitive data
- Line 296-297: Logs creating LLM client - **Properly handles base URL** by using the helper function `getBaseURLLogSuffix`
- Line 305: Logs successful client creation - No sensitive data
- Line 314, A320, 329, 338: Logs getting model names - No sensitive data

#### registry_token_precedence_test.go
- This is a test file containing test logger implementations and mock objects
- The logger calls in this file are not part of the production code
- No sensitive data is logged in the test implementations

### Safety Practices Observed
1. **No direct logging of API keys** - API keys are validated for presence but never logged
2. **Careful handling of base URLs** - The code uses a helper function `getBaseURLLogSuffix` that avoids logging the full base URL
3. **Error handling** - When logging errors, only the error message is included without any sensitive data
4. **Only logging public identifiers** - Model and provider names are logged, but these are public identifiers
5. **Empty API key detection** - The code detects when API keys are empty and logs that fact without revealing the key

## Conclusion
The registry package demonstrates good practices for secure logging, avoiding any instances where API keys, tokens, or other sensitive information might be exposed in logs. The code shows an awareness of security concerns by using helper functions to sanitize URLs and by logging only the presence/absence of API keys rather than their values.

## Recommendations
While no immediate security issues were found, the following recommendations could further enhance the security of the logging practices:

1. Consider adding explicit documentation in the registry package to remind developers of the importance of not logging sensitive information.
2. Continue the good practice of using helper functions to sanitize potentially sensitive information before logging.
3. Consider implementing a mechanism to automatically detect and redact sensitive patterns (like API keys) from log messages as an additional safeguard.
