# Task: Ensure debug-level logging is preserved

## Goal
Review the spinner code to identify any debug-level logging that was present and ensure equivalent `logger.Debug(msg)` calls are added to the code where spinner functionality has been replaced.

## Approaches Considered

### Approach 1: Add Debug Logging Alongside Info Logging
Identify places where spinner Start and UpdateMessage methods were replaced with logger.Info calls and add corresponding logger.Debug calls with the same message to match the original spinner behavior.

**Pros:**
- Most precisely replicates the original behavior of the spinner
- Ensures no loss of debug-level logging information
- Maintains existing log granularity for debugging purposes

**Cons:**
- Adds redundant code (duplicate log calls at different levels)
- Could clutter the code with multiple log statements for the same event
- May be unnecessary if the debug logs were only used for internal spinner functionality

### Approach 2: Selectively Add Debug Logging Based on Usage Pattern
Analyze how the debug logs were actually used and only add logger.Debug calls where they provide meaningful additional information beyond the Info level logging.

**Pros:**
- Results in cleaner code with less redundancy
- Only adds debug logging where it's actually beneficial
- Potentially improves log output quality

**Cons:**
- Requires more judgment about which debug logs are important
- Could miss some debug information that was previously available
- Deviates from the spinner's original implementation

### Approach 3: Configure Logger to Duplicate Important Messages
Modify the logger configuration so that certain Info messages are automatically duplicated to the Debug level without adding explicit duplicate calls.

**Pros:**
- Clean implementation with no code duplication
- Centralized control over logging behavior
- Flexible and configurable approach

**Cons:**
- Requires changes to the logging system itself
- More complex and goes beyond the task scope
- Could affect other parts of the application

## Chosen Implementation Approach
**Approach 1: Add Debug Logging Alongside Info Logging**

I will implement a solution that adds logger.Debug calls alongside the logger.Info calls that replaced spinner methods which had debug-level logging. Based on examination of the spinner code, this affects:

1. All former `spinnerInstance.Start()` calls
2. All former `spinnerInstance.UpdateMessage()` calls

Implementation steps:
1. Review the initial spinner usage documentation to identify all the Start and UpdateMessage call sites in main.go
2. Check our previous replacements for these methods to ensure we have the complete list
3. Add a corresponding logger.Debug call after each logger.Info call that replaced a spinner Start or UpdateMessage method
4. Maintain identical message formatting between Info and Debug level logs

## Reasoning for Approach
I've chosen Approach 1 for several important reasons:

1. **Complete Preservation**: It most precisely preserves the exact behavior of the original spinner package, which logged at both Info and Debug levels for Start and UpdateMessage methods.

2. **Minimal Risk**: Adding Debug logs alongside Info logs is a simple change with low risk of introducing errors or altering application behavior.

3. **Backward Compatibility**: Keeping the same debug logging ensures that users running in debug mode will see the same level of detail they previously had with the spinner.

4. **Consistency with Task Goal**: The task specifically calls for preserving debug-level logging, and this approach does that most directly.

5. **Avoid Judgment Calls**: Unlike Approach 2, this approach doesn't require subjective decisions about which debug logs are "important enough" to keep.

While there is some code duplication, the clarity and completeness of the solution outweigh this concern. Additionally, the spinner implementation itself contained this "duplication" by design, suggesting it was an intentional part of the logging strategy.
