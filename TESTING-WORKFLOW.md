# Testing the GitHub Actions Workflow

This document contains instructions for testing the GitHub Actions workflow and notes on expected behavior.

## Test Pull Request Instructions

To create a test pull request that will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow:

1. Create a new branch from the current state:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/workflow-validation
   ```

2. Make a small change (this file serves as that change)

3. Commit the change:
   ```bash
   git add TESTING-WORKFLOW.md
   git commit -m "test: add workflow testing documentation"
   ```

4. Push the branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin test/workflow-validation
   ```

5. Create a pull request from the `test/workflow-validation` branch to the `master` branch on GitHub

## Expected Behavior

When the pull request is created, you should observe:

1. The GitHub Actions workflow automatically triggers
2. Three jobs run in the following order:
   - `lint` job runs first
   - `test` job runs after the lint job completes successfully
   - `build` job runs after the test job completes successfully

3. Each job should complete the following steps:

   **Lint job:**
   - Checkout code
   - Set up Go environment
   - Verify dependencies
   - Check formatting
   - Run vet
   - Run golangci-lint

   **Test job:**
   - Checkout code
   - Set up Go environment
   - Run tests with race detection
   - Generate coverage report
   - Display coverage summary
   - Check coverage threshold

   **Build job:**
   - Checkout code
   - Set up Go environment
   - Build the project
   - Upload artifact

4. After all jobs complete successfully, the pull request should show green checkmarks for all status checks

## Artifact Verification

After the workflow completes:

1. Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository
2. Click on the completed workflow run
3. In the summary, check for the `architect-binary` artifact
4. Download and verify the artifact to ensure it's the compiled binary

## Troubleshooting

If any job fails:

1. Click on the failed job to see detailed logs
2. Identify the specific step that failed
3. Fix the issue in the workflow or code
4. Push the changes to the same branch to trigger the workflow again

## Notes for Future Improvements

Based on the test PR observations, consider:

- Job timing and potential optimizations
- Step dependencies and parallelization opportunities
- Additional status checks or validations
- Documentation improvements for the workflow
