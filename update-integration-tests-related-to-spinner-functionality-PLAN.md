# Update integration tests related to spinner functionality

## Task Goal
Update any integration tests that use or reference spinner functionality to ensure they continue to work with the logging-based approach that has replaced the spinner visualization.

## Implementation Approach
Based on my analysis of the codebase, I will take the following approach:

1. **Remove References to --no-spinner Flag**: 
   - The `noSpinnerFlag` has already been removed from main_adapter.go, but I'll verify there are no remaining test cases that explicitly set this flag

2. **Check for Direct Spinner Usage**:
   - Verify that no tests directly interact with or validate spinner behavior
   - Ensure that test mocks and environments no longer depend on spinner functionality

3. **Update Test Helper Methods**:
   - Update any helper methods in the test environment that might have been used for spinner testing

4. **Verify Test Coverage**:
   - Run the integration tests to confirm they still work with the new logging-based approach
   - Add test case comments where appropriate to document the change from spinner to logging

## Reasoning for Selected Approach
I considered three potential approaches:

1. **Complete Test Redesign**: Redesign integration tests to explicitly validate the new logging-based approach. This would involve creating new tests specifically for logging output verification.

2. **Minimal Changes (Selected)**: Focus only on removing direct spinner dependencies while keeping test behavior the same. This approach assumes that tests are already validating the correct behavior at a higher level, rather than checking specific implementation details (spinner vs. logging).

3. **Hybrid Approach**: Remove spinner dependencies and add some logging-specific tests without a complete redesign.

I've chosen the second option for these reasons:

1. After reviewing the integration tests, I found that they don't directly test spinner functionality or rely on spinner-specific behavior. They test higher-level outcomes like file generation and error handling.

2. The tests appear to focus on behavior rather than implementation details, which is a best practice. They validate what the system does, not how it does it.

3. The integration tests use mocks and test helpers that abstract away many implementation details, making them more resilient to changes like replacing spinner with logging.

4. The tests continue to pass even after we've removed the spinner code, which suggests they weren't tightly coupled to spinner implementation.

This approach is the most efficient as it maintains the current test structure while ensuring they work correctly with the new logging-based approach. It respects the existing testing philosophy of validating outputs rather than implementation details.
