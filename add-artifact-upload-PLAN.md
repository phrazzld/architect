# Add artifact upload

## Goal
Add a step to the build job that uploads the compiled 'architect' binary as a workflow artifact for later use or downloading.

## Implementation Approach
Update the build job in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to add a new step after the build step:

1. Use the official `actions/upload-artifact@v4` GitHub Action to upload the binary
2. Configure the artifact with a clear name to identify it
3. Specify the correct path to the 'architect' binary generated in the previous build step
4. Set an appropriate retention period for the artifact

## Reasoning

1. **Official action**: Using the official `actions/upload-artifact` action is the standard way to store artifacts in GitHub Actions. The action is well-maintained and provides good integration with the GitHub UI for later downloading.

2. **Latest version**: Using v4 of the action gives us access to the latest features and performance improvements.

3. **Descriptive artifact name**: Using a clear name like 'architect-binary' makes it easy to identify the artifact in the GitHub UI and when later referencing it in potential download steps or follow-up workflows.

4. **Retention period**: Setting a moderate retention period (7 days is typical) balances storage usage with availability. This ensures the binary is available long enough for testing and verification, but doesn't consume storage resources indefinitely.

5. **Binary path accuracy**: Ensuring we reference the correct output path from the build step (simply 'architect' in the workspace root) is critical for the upload to succeed.
