# Task: Add integration tests for prompt file usage

## Background
The architect tool has recently been updated to enhance its template processing capabilities. The `generateAndSavePlanWithPromptManager` function has been modified to handle task file content appropriately, and a new `FileIsTemplate` detection mechanism has been implemented to determine if a file should be processed as a template or used as raw content.

These updates need to be validated with integration tests to ensure the complete workflow functions correctly with various prompt file formats.

## Task Details
- **Action:** Create integration tests that validate the complete workflow with various prompt file formats.
- **Depends On:** Update generateAndSavePlanWithPromptManager function, Add fileIsTemplate detection mechanism
- **AC Ref:** Integration testing (Testing Strategy)

## Requirements
The integration tests should:
1. Test different types of template files (with and without template variables)
2. Test files with `.tmpl` extension and without (to verify the `FileIsTemplate` detection mechanism)
3. Validate the complete workflow from reading the file to generating output
4. Ensure proper error handling when encountering invalid templates
5. Follow the project's testing conventions and best practices

## Request
Please provide 2-3 implementation approaches for creating these integration tests, including:
1. A detailed description of each approach
2. Pros and cons of each approach
3. A recommended approach based on the project's standards and testability principles
4. Specific files that would need to be modified or created
5. A high-level implementation plan

Consider how to test the full workflow in an integration context, possibly including test fixtures, mocking external dependencies like the API calls, and ensuring good test coverage of the new template processing features.
