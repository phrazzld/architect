# Add transitional comments to original main.go

## Goal
Mark functions in the original main.go with "Transitional implementation" comments as they're moved to the new structure, to clearly indicate which functions are now duplicated and destined for removal.

## Implementation Approach
I'll use a systematic approach that identifies all functions that have been moved to other files and adds appropriate transitional comments:

1. **Identification and Documentation**:
   - Review main.go to identify all functions that have been moved to other component files
   - For each moved function, add a descriptive comment indicating:
     - That it's a transitional implementation
     - Where the new implementation resides
     - When it's planned to be removed

2. **Comment Format Standardization**:
   - Use a consistent format for all transitional comments
   - Include clear indicators that make the comments easy to search for later
   - Add TODO markers to help IDEs highlight these as pending items

## Reasoning for Approach
I've chosen this approach for several reasons:

1. **Clarity and Traceability**:
   - Clear comments will help developers understand which components have been refactored
   - References to new implementations will make it easy to compare old and new code
   - Having a standard format makes future clean-up efforts more systematic

2. **Alternative Approaches Considered**:
   - Simply removing the old functions: Rejected because it would break existing code paths before the transition is complete
   - Using code deprecation annotations: Rejected because these are internal functions, not public API
   - Moving all functions to a legacy.go file: Rejected because it would complicate the refactoring process without adding value

3. **Minimal Disruption**:
   - This approach allows for gradual transition without breaking existing functionality
   - Supports the "pure refactoring" approach mentioned in the refactoring guidelines
   - Facilitates incremental testing throughout the transition
