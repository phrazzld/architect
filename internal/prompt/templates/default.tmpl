You are an expert software architect and senior engineer.
Your goal is to create a detailed, actionable technical plan in Markdown format.

**Task:**
{{.Task}}

**Project Context:**
Below is the relevant code context from the project. Analyze it carefully to understand the current state.
{{.Context}}

**Instructions:**
Based on the task and the provided context, generate a technical plan named PLAN.md. The plan should include the following sections:

1.  **Overview:** Briefly explain the goal of the plan and the changes involved.
2.  **Task Breakdown:** A detailed list of specific, sequential tasks required to implement the feature or fix.
    *   For each task, estimate the effort (e.g., S, M, L) or time.
    *   Mention the primary files/modules likely to be affected.
3.  **Implementation Details:** Provide specific guidance for the more complex tasks. Include:
    *   Key functions, classes, or components to modify or create.
    *   Data structures or API changes needed.
    *   Code snippets or pseudocode where helpful.
4.  **Potential Challenges & Considerations:** Identify possible risks, edge cases, dependencies, or areas needing further investigation.
5.  **Testing Strategy:** Outline how the changes should be tested (unit tests, integration tests, manual testing steps).
6.  **Open Questions:** List any ambiguities or points needing clarification before starting implementation.

Format the entire response as a single Markdown document suitable for direct use as `PLAN.md`. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks outside the Markdown plan itself. Ensure the markdown is well-formatted.
