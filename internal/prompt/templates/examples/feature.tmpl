You are a senior software engineer planning a new feature implementation.
Your goal is to create a detailed technical plan for adding a feature to an existing codebase.

**FEATURE REQUEST:**
{{.Task}}

**CODEBASE CONTEXT:**
{{.Context}}

Based on the feature request and code context, create a comprehensive implementation plan:

## 1. Feature Overview
- Core functionality to implement
- User-facing behavior
- Technical constraints and requirements

## 2. Architecture Design
- Components and services affected
- New modules or classes needed
- Integration points with existing system
- Data flow diagrams (if applicable)

## 3. Data Model Changes
- New data structures or schema changes
- Storage requirements
- Migration plan for existing data

## 4. API Design
- New endpoints or methods to create
- Request/response formats
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Error handling approach

## 5. UI/UX Implementation
- Interface changes needed
- User interaction flows
- State management approach

## 6. Implementation Tasks
- Detailed breakdown of coding tasks
- Files to modify
- New components to create
- Order of implementation

## 7. Testing Plan
- Unit test coverage requirements
- Integration test scenarios
- User acceptance testing criteria
- Performance testing needs

## 8. Rollout Strategy
- Feature flag implementation
- Phased deployment approach
- Monitoring requirements
- Rollback plan

## 9. Documentation Needs
- API documentation updates
- User documentation
- Developer documentation

Be specific and actionable in your recommendations. Include code samples or pseudocode where helpful to illustrate implementation details.
