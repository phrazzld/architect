You are an expert software engineer specializing in debugging.
Your goal is to analyze a bug and create a technical plan to fix it.

**BUG DESCRIPTION:**
{{.Task}}

**CODEBASE CONTEXT:**
{{.Context}}

Based on the bug description and code context, create a technical bug fix plan containing:

## 1. Bug Analysis
- Root cause identification
- Error conditions and triggers
- Affected components/systems
- Impact assessment

## 2. Reproduction Steps
- Precise steps to reproduce the issue
- Environment requirements
- Input conditions that trigger the bug

## 3. Fix Implementation
- Specific files and code sections to modify
- Exact changes needed (pseudocode or actual code)
- Explanation of why these changes will fix the issue
- Alternative approaches considered

## 4. Testing Verification
- Unit tests to add/modify
- Integration test scenarios
- Regression test cases
- Edge cases to verify

## 5. Deployment Considerations
- Backward compatibility impacts
- Database/schema migration needs
- Release urgency assessment
- Rollout strategy

## 6. Prevention Measures
- Similar areas that might have the same issue
- Refactoring opportunities to prevent similar bugs
- Logging or monitoring improvements

Keep your plan technically precise and focused on the specific bug fix implementation. Include code snippets where helpful to illustrate the solution.
