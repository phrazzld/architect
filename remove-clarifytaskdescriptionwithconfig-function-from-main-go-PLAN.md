# Remove clarifyTaskDescriptionWithConfig() function from main.go

## Goal
The goal is to remove the `clarifyTaskDescriptionWithConfig()` function from main.go as part of the ongoing effort to remove all clarify-related functionality from the codebase.

## Implementation Approach
The implementation will be straightforward since the function appears to be unused in the codebase:

1. Delete the entire `clarifyTaskDescriptionWithConfig()` function (lines 109-120 in main.go)
2. Verify that removing the function doesn't break any functionality
3. Run tests to ensure everything still works as expected

## Reasoning
This approach is the most suitable because:

1. The function appears to be unused in the codebase, as evidenced by the absence of any direct calls to it.
2. This is a simple deletion as part of a larger cleanup effort.
3. The removal aligns with the overall project goal of simplifying the codebase by removing clarify-related functionality.
4. No replacement functionality is needed as the clarify feature is being removed entirely.
