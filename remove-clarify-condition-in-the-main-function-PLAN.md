# Remove clarify condition in the main function

## Goal
The goal of this task is to remove the if block `if config.ClarifyTask && !config.DryRun {...}` from the main function in main.go as part of the ongoing effort to remove all clarify-related functionality from the codebase.

## Implementation Approach
After examining the codebase, I've discovered that this task has already been completed in a previous commit (18ac66ac8533e88b9ec42f669fac001f3f1f6277). The if block has been replaced with a comment "Task clarification code has been removed" on line 95 of main.go.

The approach is to:
1. Verify that the if block has been completely removed
2. Update the TODO.md file to mark this task as completed
3. Commit the changes to track this verification

## Reasoning
This approach is most suitable because:

1. The code modification has already been completed in a previous commit
2. It's important to properly mark tasks as completed in the TODO.md file for tracking progress
3. This verification ensures that the task is properly accounted for in the overall project cleanup
4. Marking the task as complete will unblock dependent tasks in the TODO.md file
