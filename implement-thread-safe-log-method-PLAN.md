# Implement thread-safe Log method

## Goal
Enhance the `Log` method of the `FileLogger` struct to ensure complete thread safety and robust error handling. The method should reliably log events even when called concurrently from multiple goroutines and handle error conditions gracefully.

## Implementation Approach
I'll enhance the existing `Log` method in `logger.go` with the following improvements:

1. **Null Check Protection** - Add validation to ensure the logger and file handle aren't nil before proceeding
2. **Enhanced JSON Marshaling** - Improve the JSON marshaling with better error details
3. **Buffered Writes** - Use buffered writing for improved performance
4. **Documented Thread Safety** - Add comprehensive documentation about thread safety
5. **Advanced Error Handling** - Enhance error handling with context-rich error messages and appropriate error recovery strategies
6. **Retry Mechanism** - Add selective retry for transient errors
7. **File State Validation** - Check file state before writing

These enhancements will build on the existing mutex lock/unlock mechanism already implemented in the method. The focus will be on making the method more robust without significantly changing its basic structure.

## Reasoning
I chose this approach for the following reasons:

1. **Build on Existing Foundation** - The method already has basic mutex locking in place, so we can enhance it without a complete rewrite.

2. **Comprehensive Safety** - The enhanced implementation will handle various edge cases like nil pointers and closed files, preventing runtime panics.

3. **Performance Considerations** - Using buffered writing can improve performance for frequent logging operations while maintaining thread safety.

4. **Balanced Error Handling** - The approach strikes a balance between proper error reporting and not disrupting the application flow, which is essential for logging systems.

5. **Maintainability** - Clear documentation about thread safety helps future maintainers understand the concurrency guarantees.

6. **Robustness** - Adding file state validation ensures the logger can recover from some error conditions and continue functioning.

The implementation will focus on making the method more robust while maintaining its current simple API and not significantly changing its behavior from the caller's perspective.
