# Analysis: Update `architect.Execute` call in `main.go`

## Task Description
Modify the call to `architect.Execute` in `main.go`. Pass the `coreConfig` (derived from `cmdConfig`) and `logger`. Remove the `configManager` argument. Ensure the arguments match the updated `Execute` signature.

## Changes Made
Updated the call to `architect.Execute` in `main.go`. The change was straightforward:

From:
```go
err = architect.Execute(ctx, coreConfig, logger, configManager)
```

To:
```go
err = architect.Execute(ctx, coreConfig, logger)
```

## Implementation Details
1. The `configManager` parameter was removed from the function call
2. The remaining parameters (`ctx`, `coreConfig`, and `logger`) were kept as they were
3. This modification aligns with the updated function signature in `internal/architect/app.go`

## Impact
This change completes a critical step in removing the file-based configuration system. By removing the `configManager` parameter from the function call, we ensure the code will compile now that the function signature in `internal/architect/app.go` has been updated.

## Verification
The changes align with the PLAN.md Step 5, which calls for removing file-based configuration in favor of using defaults, command-line flags, and environment variables exclusively.
