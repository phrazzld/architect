# Analysis: Remove `configManager` initialization and usage in `main.go`

## Task Description
Delete the lines related to `config.NewManager`, `configManager.LoadFromFiles`, `configManager.EnsureConfigDirs`, `configManager.MergeWithFlags`, and `configManager.GetConfig` from `cmd/architect/main.go`.

## Changes Made
1. Removed the initialization of `configManager` using `config.NewManager(logger)`
2. Removed the block of code that loaded configuration from files
3. Removed the block of code that ensured configuration directories exist
4. Removed the conversion of CLI flags and merging with loaded configuration
5. Removed getting the final configuration from the config manager
6. Removed the import of the `config` package

## Implementation Details
I replaced the removed code blocks with comments indicating the new approach of using CLI flags and environment variables for configuration. This maintains code readability while clearly indicating the direction of the refactoring.

The following code sections were removed:
- `configManager := config.NewManager(logger)`
- The entire block for `configManager.LoadFromFiles()`
- The entire block for `configManager.EnsureConfigDirs()`
- The entire block for `ConvertConfigToMap()` and `configManager.MergeWithFlags()`
- The line calling `configManager.GetConfig()`

## Outstanding Issues
The `architect.Execute` function call still includes the `configManager` parameter, but the variable no longer exists. This will intentionally cause a compilation error until the next task, which is specifically about updating the `Execute` call. This is part of the staged refactoring approach outlined in the plan.

## Verification
The changes align with the PLAN.md Step 5, which calls for removing file-based configuration in favor of using defaults, command-line flags, and environment variables exclusively.
