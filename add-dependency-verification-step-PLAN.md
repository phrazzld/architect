# Add dependency verification step

## Goal
Add a step to the workflow that verifies the integrity of Go module dependencies using the `go mod verify` command.

## Implementation Approach
Update the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to add a new step in the lint job after the Go setup step:

1. Add a step with a clear name indicating it's verifying dependencies
2. Use the `run` directive to execute the `go mod verify` command
3. Ensure this step comes after the Go environment setup but before any other dependency-related steps

## Reasoning

1. **Placement in the workflow**: Adding this step to the lint job is appropriate since dependency verification is a form of static checking that should happen early in the workflow. If dependencies are invalid, it's better to catch this issue before running tests or builds.

2. **Simple command execution**: The `go mod verify` command checks the cryptographic checksums of all dependencies in the Go module cache against the expected values in the `go.sum` file, ensuring the integrity of dependencies. Using a plain `run` step is the most straightforward approach for this simple command.

3. **Security focus**: Verifying dependencies is crucial for security, ensuring that no dependencies have been tampered with. This is especially important in CI pipelines where dependencies may be cached between runs.

4. **Execution time consideration**: While we could add this step to all jobs, it's most efficient to run it only once in the lint job, since the verification will be the same across all jobs. If the lint job passes the verification, there's no need to repeat it in the test and build jobs.
