# Remove clarifyTaskDescriptionWithPromptManager() function from main.go

## Goal
The goal is to remove the `clarifyTaskDescriptionWithPromptManager()` function from main.go as part of the ongoing effort to remove all clarify-related functionality from the codebase.

## Implementation Approach
The implementation will be straightforward since the function appears to be unused in the codebase:

1. Delete the entire `clarifyTaskDescriptionWithPromptManager()` function (lines 109-232 in main.go)
2. Verify that removing the function doesn't break any functionality by running tests
3. Update the TODO.md file to mark this task as completed

## Reasoning
This approach is the most suitable because:

1. The function is not called by any other functions in the codebase, making it safe to remove
2. This is part of a systematic cleanup of all clarify-related functionality
3. The removal aligns with other changes already made to remove the clarify feature
4. No replacement functionality is needed as the clarify feature is being removed entirely
5. Simple deletion reduces the codebase size and removes dead code
