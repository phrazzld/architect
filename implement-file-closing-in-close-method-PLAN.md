# Implement file closing in Close method

## Goal
Enhance the `Close` method of the `FileLogger` struct to ensure proper and reliable cleanup of file resources, with comprehensive error handling and safety mechanisms.

## Implementation Summary
I successfully enhanced the `Close` method in `logger.go` with the following improvements:

1. **Nil Receiver Protection** - Added validation to handle nil logger instances, returning a descriptive error
2. **File State Verification** - Added checks to verify the file state before attempting to close
3. **Enhanced Error Wrapping** - Improved error reporting with context-rich errors and specific handling for permission issues
4. **Synchronous Flushing** - Added file.Sync() call to ensure any buffered data is written to disk before closing
5. **Resource Cleanup** - Maintained setting the file handle to nil after closing to prevent use-after-close issues
6. **Documentation Enhancement** - Added comprehensive documentation about close behavior and return values

I also added several new tests to verify the enhanced functionality:

1. **TestFileLoggerCloseNilReceiver** - Verifies proper handling of nil receivers
2. **TestFileLoggerCloseSync** - Tests that Sync is called and data is persisted during Close
3. **TestFileLoggerNilFileClose** - Ensures graceful handling of nil file handles

## Results
The implementation successfully meets all the requirements:

1. **Thread Safety** - The Close method is fully thread-safe due to mutex protection
2. **Idempotency** - Multiple calls to Close are handled properly
3. **Data Integrity** - All buffered data is properly flushed before closing
4. **Error Handling** - Clear error messages are provided for different failure scenarios
5. **Resource Management** - File handles are properly released and nullified

All tests pass, ensuring the robustness of the implementation.

## Next Steps
With this task complete, the StructuredLogger interface and its implementations (FileLogger and NoopLogger) are now fully functional. The next steps according to the TODO.md file would be to integrate this logger with the application's configuration system.
