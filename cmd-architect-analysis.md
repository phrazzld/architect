# Analysis of cmd/architect/ Implementation

This document provides a thorough analysis of the existing cmd/architect/main.go and cmd/architect/cli.go files to guide the upcoming refactoring tasks.

## 1. Structure and Component Analysis

### cmd/architect/cli.go

**Public Functions:**
- `ParseFlags()`: Entry point for flag parsing, returns CliConfig and error
- `ParseFlagsWithEnv(flagSet, args, getenv)`: Testable version that allows injecting dependencies
- `SetupLogging(config)`: Initializes the logger based on configuration
- `SetupLoggingCustom(config, logLevelFlag, output)`: Testable version allowing custom output and flag values
- `ConvertConfigToMap(cliConfig)`: Converts CliConfig to a map for config.Manager.MergeWithFlags

**Primary Data Structures:**
- `CliConfig`: Holds parsed command-line options including TaskDescription, TaskFile, formatting options, and execution flags

**Direct Dependencies:**
- Standard library: `flag`, `fmt`, `io`, `os`
- Internal packages: `config`, `logutil`

### cmd/architect/main.go

**Public Functions:**
- `Main()`: Entry point for the application, orchestrates the full execution flow
- `OriginalMain(cliConfig, loggerObj, configManagerObj, auditLoggerObj, uiObj)`: Transitional function that calls the original main.go logic

**Helper Functions:**
- `initAuditLogger(appConfig, logger)`: Creates and configures an audit logger
- `newLogProvider(logger, auditLogger)`: Creates a logProvider struct
- `setService(service)` and `getService()`: Global state management for service instance
- `countTokens(ctx, text, llmClient)`: Helper for token counting

**Internal Types:**
- `logProvider`: Implements core.LogProvider interface
- `stubLLMClient`: Temporary implementation of core.LLMClient interface

**Direct Dependencies:**
- Standard library: `context`, `fmt`, `os`, `strings`
- Internal packages:
  - Adapters: `adapters/cliui`, `adapters/filesystem`, `adapters/git`
  - Core packages: `auditlog`, `config`, `context` (aliased as contextService), `core`, `logutil`, `plan`, `prompt`

## 2. Interface and Abstraction Analysis

### Key Interfaces

- `logutil.LoggerInterface`: Abstraction for logging functionality
- `auditlog.StructuredLogger`: Interface for structured audit logging
- `core.UserInterface`: Interface for user interactions (implemented by cliui.Adapter)
- `core.LLMClient`: Interface for LLM operations (temporarily implemented by stubLLMClient)
- `core.LogProvider`: Interface for accessing loggers (implemented by logProvider)
- `config.ManagerInterface`: Interface for configuration management

### Adapter Patterns

The code uses several adapters to abstract external dependencies:
- `cliui.Adapter`: Abstraction for CLI user interface
- `filesystem.OSFileSystem`: Adapter for filesystem operations
- `git.CLIChecker`: Adapter for git operations
- `auditlog.FileLogger`/`NoopLogger`: Adapters for audit logging

These adapters create clear boundaries for external dependencies, which aligns with the "Mock External Boundaries" principle in the testing philosophy.

## 3. Execution Flow Analysis

### Main Function Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Parse command-line flags using `ParseFlags()` from cli.go
   - Set up logging using `SetupLogging()` from cli.go
   - Initialize the CLI UI adapter and display startup info
   - Initialize configuration management and temporary audit logger
   - Load and merge configurations

2. **Component Creation**:
   - Initialize structured audit logger
   - Create stub LLM client (temporary implementation)
   - Create prompt manager
   - Create filesystem adapter
   - Create git checker
   - Create context gatherer
   - Create file writer
   - Create plan generator
   - Create the core service, injecting all dependencies

3. **Task Clarification** (if enabled):
   - Use service.ClarifyTask to refine task description
   - Update CLI config with refined task

4. **Execution**:
   - Call OriginalMain with the initialized components

### OriginalMain Function Flow

1. **Setup**:
   - Retrieve the core service instance
   - Create a context
   - Read task file if specified

2. **Context Gathering**:
   - Log the action
   - Use service.GatherContext to collect project files
   - Process the results

3. **Execution Path Branching**:
   - If in dry run mode, display stats and exit
   - Otherwise, generate and save the plan

4. **Plan Generation**:
   - Call service.GenerateAndSavePlan with the task, context, and output location
   - Handle any errors
   - Display success message

## 4. Component Responsibility Mapping

### Already Implemented in cmd/architect/

1. **CLI Parsing (cli.go)**:
   - Flag definition and parsing
   - Input validation
   - Environment variable handling

2. **Logging Setup (cli.go)**:
   - Log level determination
   - Logger initialization
   - Color output support

3. **Component Orchestration (main.go)**:
   - Service initialization
   - Dependency injection
   - Configuration management
   - Basic task clarification
   - Execution flow management

### Still in Original main.go (to be refactored)

1. **Token Management**:
   - Token counting
   - Token limit checking
   - User confirmation for large token counts

2. **API Interaction**:
   - Gemini client initialization
   - API response processing
   - Error handling

3. **Context Gathering**:
   - File collection and filtering
   - Context statistics calculation
   - Dry run information display

4. **Prompt Building**:
   - Task file reading
   - Template processing
   - Example template handling

5. **Output Handling**:
   - Plan generation
   - File writing
   - Success/failure reporting

## 5. Integration Points for New Components

Based on the analysis, here are the key integration points for the new specialized files:

### token.go
- Will be used by `OriginalMain` for token counting
- Should interface with `core.LLMClient` for token operations
- Should provide console interaction for confirmation prompts

### api.go
- Will replace `stubLLMClient` with actual implementation
- Should handle all Gemini API interactions
- Will connect to the `core.Service` through the LLMClient interface

### context.go
- Will implement the context gathering logic
- Should interact with filesystem adapters
- Will connect to token.go for calculating token statistics

### prompt.go
- Will handle template loading and processing
- Should integrate with configuration manager for finding templates
- Should provide task file reading functionality

### output.go
- Will manage plan generation and file writing
- Should interact with prompt.go for building the final prompt
- Should connect to api.go for content generation

## 6. Testing Implications

The current architecture in cmd/architect/ strongly supports the project's testing philosophy:

1. **Behavior Over Implementation**:
   - Components interact through well-defined interfaces
   - External dependencies are accessed through adapters
   - Main logic is organized into distinct components with clear responsibilities

2. **Minimize Mocking**:
   - External dependencies (filesystem, UI, git) are already abstracted
   - Testing can focus on mocking only these external boundaries
   - Components can be tested with their real collaborators

3. **Testability Design**:
   - Dependency injection is used extensively
   - Alternate function signatures with testable parameters exist
   - Global state is minimized (except for the temporary service instance)

This architecture provides a solid foundation for maintaining testability as we move the remaining functionality from the original main.go into the new specialized files.

## 7. Conclusion

The cmd/architect/ implementation demonstrates a clear direction toward component-based architecture with dependency injection and clean interfaces. The existing code already handles CLI parsing, logging setup, and high-level orchestration, with a transitional bridge to the original main.go functionality.

Our refactoring work should focus on:
1. Extracting the specialized functionality from the original main.go into the new files
2. Maintaining the same architectural patterns (interfaces, adapters, dependency injection)
3. Gradually transitioning from the original implementation to the new components
4. Ensuring all existing tests continue to pass throughout the process

This analysis provides a clear roadmap for the upcoming refactoring tasks, ensuring that the new components will integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture while maintaining testability and code quality.
