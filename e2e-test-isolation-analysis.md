# E2E Test Isolation Analysis

## Resource Isolation Assessment

The E2E tests in the Architect project demonstrate good resource isolation practices that would support parallel test execution with minimal changes.

### Positive Isolation Practices

1. **Isolated Temporary Directories:**
   - Each test uses `t.TempDir()` which creates an isolated directory that:
     - Is automatically cleaned up when the test completes
     - Has a unique path for each test
     - Is compatible with parallel test execution
   - Example from `TestBasicExecution`:
     ```go
     env := NewTestEnv(t) // Internally uses t.TempDir()
     ```

2. **Independent Mock Servers:**
   - Each test gets its own `httptest.Server` instance via `env.startMockServer()`
   - These servers use dynamic port allocation (no hard-coded ports)
   - Servers are cleaned up via `defer env.Cleanup()`
   - Example from `NewTestEnv`:
     ```go
     // Start the mock server
     env.startMockServer()
     ```

3. **Isolated Test Environments:**
   - Each test creates its own `TestEnv` instance
   - `TestEnv` contains a complete test environment including:
     - Temporary directory
     - Mock server
     - Mock API handlers
     - Default flags
   - No shared mutable state between test environments

4. **Proper Cleanup:**
   - All tests use `defer env.Cleanup()` to ensure resources are released
   - Mock servers are properly shut down in the `Cleanup` method
   - Example:
     ```go
     env := NewTestEnv(t)
     defer env.Cleanup()
     ```

5. **Read-Only Shared Resources:**
   - The only shared state is `architectBinaryPath` which is:
     - Initialized once in `TestMain`
     - Used read-only by all tests
     - Thread-safe for parallel access

6. **Subtest Support:**
   - Tests that use table-driven tests properly use `t.Run()`:
     ```go
     for _, tc := range testCases {
         t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
             // Test implementation
         })
     }
     ```

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Enabling Parallelism:**
   - Tests don't currently include `t.Parallel()` calls
   - Adding `t.Parallel()` to top-level test functions would enable concurrent execution:
     ```go
     func TestBasicExecution(t *testing.T) {
         t.Parallel() // Add this line
         // Rest of test...
     }
     ```

2. **Subtest Parallelism:**
   - For table-driven tests, parallelism should be enabled in the subtests:
     ```go
     t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
         t.Parallel() // Add this line
         // Rest of subtest...
     })
     ```

## Conclusion

The E2E tests in the Architect project are well-designed for isolation and would be suitable for parallel execution with minor modifications. The tests:

1. Use isolated resources (temporary directories, mock servers)
2. Properly clean up after themselves
3. Don't rely on global mutable state
4. Use testing patterns that are compatible with parallelism

**Recommendation:** Add `t.Parallel()` calls to the top-level test functions and subtests to enable parallel execution. No other significant changes are needed for test isolation.
