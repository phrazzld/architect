# Remove Viper dependency via Go modules

## Task Goal
Remove the Viper dependency from the project by using Go module commands to explicitly remove it from the project's dependencies.

## Implementation Approach
I will use the `go get` command with the `@none` suffix to remove the Viper dependency from the project's go.mod file. This is the official Go approach for removing dependencies from a module.

## Reasoning
I'm choosing this approach because:
1. Using `go get github.com/spf13/viper@none` is the officially recommended way to remove a dependency in Go modules
2. It's a direct, simple approach that requires no manual editing of go.mod files
3. It will properly update the dependency graph
4. This approach ensures the dependency is consistently removed in a way that the Go toolchain understands

This method is preferable to manually editing the go.mod file, which could lead to inconsistencies between the go.mod and go.sum files.
