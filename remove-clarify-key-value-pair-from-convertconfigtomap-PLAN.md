# Remove clarify key-value pair from ConvertConfigToMap

## Goal
Remove the `"clarify": clarifyTaskValue` entry from the ConvertConfigToMap function in `cmd/architect/cli.go` to continue the incremental cleanup of clarify-related code from the codebase.

## Chosen Implementation Approach
I'll implement this task using a straightforward approach:

1. Locate the `ConvertConfigToMap` function in `cmd/architect/cli.go` that we previously modified to use a temporary variable
2. Remove the `"clarify": clarifyTaskValue` entry entirely from the map being returned
3. Remove the temporary `clarifyTaskValue` variable we added in the previous task, as it's no longer needed
4. Verify the application builds successfully and all tests pass after these changes

## Reasoning for Approach
I chose this approach for the following reasons:

* **Clean and direct**: This approach completely eliminates the code rather than leaving commented placeholders. Since the previous task has already removed the `ClarifyTask` field from the struct, and we've put a temporary variable in place, we can now safely remove both the temporary variable and the map entry.

* **Maintains compilation**: Since we're now removing both the temporary variable and its usage, there won't be any compilation errors. We're successfully eliminating dead code in a controlled manner.

* **Follows dependency chain**: This is the next logical step after removing the `ClarifyTask` field from the struct. It continues the incremental approach to safely removing the feature.

Alternative approaches considered:
1. **Leave a comment**: We could remove the entry but leave a comment explaining what was removed. This would add historical context, but it's unnecessary since the git history already provides this information and extra comments would clutter the code.

2. **Replace with a placeholder value**: We could replace the entry with a placeholder like `"clarify": false`, but this would leave dead code that could confuse future developers about whether the feature still exists in some capacity.

The chosen approach aligns with best practices for code maintenance by cleanly removing deprecated functionality without leaving unnecessary artifacts in the codebase.
