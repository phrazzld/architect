# Remove clarify example from README

## Goal
Remove the example that demonstrates the `--clarify` flag usage from the README.md file to ensure the documentation accurately reflects the current capabilities of the application after the removal of the clarify feature.

## Implementation Approach
1. Locate the usage examples section in the README.md file
2. Find and remove the example that demonstrates the `--clarify` flag usage (around lines 87-88)
3. Ensure that the formatting and structure of the remaining examples is maintained
4. Verify that the removal doesn't disrupt the overall readability or flow of the documentation

## Reasoning
This direct approach addresses the task requirement by simply removing the specific example that demonstrates a feature that no longer exists. This ensures that users aren't confused by documentation showing functionality that's been removed from the codebase.

The key consideration with this approach is to ensure that the removal doesn't disrupt the structure of the surrounding content. Since Markdown code blocks and examples are usually well-formatted, removing one example should be straightforward without affecting the rest of the document.

Alternative approaches might include:
1. Replacing the example with a different one - This would maintain the same number of examples but isn't necessary if the remaining examples adequately demonstrate the application's features.
2. Adding a comment about the feature being removed - This would be redundant since we're removing all references to the feature.

The chosen approach is the simplest and most direct, aligning with the goal of completely removing references to the clarify feature from the codebase and documentation.
