**Task: Update Config Tests (`internal/config/loader_test.go`, `legacy_config_test.go`)**

## Goal
Update the configuration loader tests to align with the removal of template-related functionality and fields. This includes removing tests for `GetTemplatePath`, handling of template-related configuration fields, and ensuring the legacy configuration tests properly handle template fields as ignored.

## Implementation Approach
1. Update `loader_test.go`:
   - Remove the `TestGetTemplatePath` function entirely as this functionality has been removed
   - Update `TestMergeWithFlags` to remove tests for template-related flag merging
   - Update `TestAutomaticInitialization` to remove checks for template directory creation
   - Update `TestDisplayInitializationMessage` to remove expectations for template-related messages
   - Ensure all other tests still function correctly with the modified config structure

2. Update `legacy_config_test.go`:
   - Replace tests that verify template-specific field handling
   - Keep tests that verify standard configuration fields are loaded correctly
   - Remove calls to removed functions like `getTemplatePathFromConfig`
   - Update tests for legacy template fields to ensure they are properly ignored

3. Ensure the test refactoring properly reflects the new configuration system:
   - Tests should verify that the core configuration functionality still works
   - Tests should not depend on any template-specific methods or fields
   - Error cases should still be properly tested

## Reasoning
The testing changes directly mirror the code changes made in previous tasks. By removing tests for the deleted functionality and updating the remaining tests to reflect the new configuration structure, we ensure that our test suite remains valid and accurately tests the current codebase.

This approach minimizes changes to the core testing logic, focusing only on removing template-related aspects. This preserves the testing of all other configuration functionality while aligning with the new design.

Some tests, like those for loading configuration files and merging flags, are still important to maintain, just without the template-specific parts. This helps ensure that the core functionality of the configuration system remains working throughout this refactoring process.
