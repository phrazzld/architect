## Completed Tasks

### 2023-04-10
- [x] **Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references**
  - **Action:** Run `grep -rE 'clarify|ClarifyTask|clarifyTaskFlag'` across the entire project and document all relevant files, functions, and code blocks.
  - **Depends On:** None
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.7
  - **Output:** Created `clarify-references.md` with categorized findings
  
- [x] **Remove clarify flag definition**
  - **Action:** In `cmd/architect/cli.go`, delete the `clarifyTaskFlag` variable definition (line ~98).
  - **Depends On:** Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.1
  - **Output:** Removed the clarify flag definition from the CLI args, added temporary variable to maintain compilation until subsequent tasks
  
- [x] **Remove ClarifyTask field from CliConfig struct**
  - **Action:** In `cmd/architect/cli.go`, delete the `ClarifyTask bool` field from the CliConfig struct (line ~39).
  - **Depends On:** Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.2
  - **Output:** Removed the ClarifyTask field from the struct while keeping temporary workarounds to maintain compatibility until subsequent tasks

- [x] **Remove clarify key-value pair from ConvertConfigToMap**
  - **Action:** In `cmd/architect/cli.go`, delete the `"clarify": cliConfig.ClarifyTask` entry from the ConvertConfigToMap function (line ~209).
  - **Depends On:** Remove ClarifyTask field from CliConfig struct
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.2
  - **Output:** Removed the clarify key and temporary variable from the map returned by ConvertConfigToMap

- [x] **Remove clarify flag from CLI usage description**
  - **Action:** In `cmd/architect/cli.go`, delete the `--clarify` flag description from the flagSet.Usage function.
  - **Depends On:** Remove clarify flag definition
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.1, AC 1.6
  - **Output:** The clarify flag was already effectively removed from the CLI usage description, as it's not shown in the help output. No specific description text was found in the flagSet.Usage function that needed removal.

- [x] **Remove ClarifyTask field from internal CliConfig**
  - **Action:** If present in `internal/architect/types.go`, delete the `ClarifyTask` field from any config struct.
  - **Depends On:** Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.2
  - **Output:** The field does not exist in the internal CliConfig struct in `internal/architect/types.go`. No explicit references to `ClarifyTask` were found in the internal/architect package.

- [x] **Remove fields from AppConfig in config.go**
  - **Action:** In `internal/config/config.go`, check for and remove any `ClarifyTask` field from the AppConfig struct if present.
  - **Depends On:** Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.2
  - **Output:** The `ClarifyTask` field does not exist in the AppConfig struct in `internal/config/config.go`. The only references to `clarify_task` are in the example config file (which will be updated in a separate task) and the legacy config test (which intentionally tests that legacy configs with this field can still be loaded).

- [x] **Remove fields from TemplateConfig**
  - **Action:** In `internal/config/config.go`, delete the `Clarify` and `Refine` fields from the TemplateConfig struct if present.
  - **Depends On:** Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.2
  - **Output:** The `Clarify` and `Refine` fields do not exist in the TemplateConfig struct in `internal/config/config.go`. References to these fields exist only in the example config file (which will be updated in a separate task) and the legacy config test (which intentionally tests that legacy configs with these fields are properly ignored).

- [x] **Update example config file**
  - **Action:** In `internal/config/example_config.toml`, remove the `clarify_task = false` line and the `clarify = "clarify.tmpl"` and `refine = "refine.tmpl"` lines under the [templates] section.
  - **Depends On:** Remove fields from TemplateConfig
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.2
  - **Output:** Removed the `clarify_task = false` line from the general configuration section and the `clarify = "clarify.tmpl"` and `refine = "refine.tmpl"` lines from the [templates] section in the example config file while maintaining proper formatting and all other configuration options.

- [x] **Remove conditional clarify logic from execution flow**
  - **Action:** In `internal/architect/app.go`, locate and remove any `if cliConfig.ClarifyTask` blocks or function calls related to the clarify feature. Ensure the standard execution path remains intact.
  - **Depends On:** Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.3
  - **Output:** After thorough examination of the `internal/architect/app.go` file and the entire `internal/architect` package, confirmed that there is no conditional logic or function calls related to the clarify feature in the execution flow. This is consistent with the findings in the clarify-references.md document which noted "No explicit references to `cliConfig.ClarifyTask` or clarify-related function calls were found in the `internal/architect` package Go files."

- [x] **Delete clarify template files**
  - **Action:** Check `internal/prompt/templates/` for `clarify.tmpl` and `refine.tmpl` and delete these files if found.
  - **Depends On:** Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.4
  - **Output:** Conducted a search for `clarify.tmpl` and `refine.tmpl` files in the `internal/prompt/templates/` directory and confirmed that these files do not exist. This finding is consistent with the clarify-references.md document which noted "No actual template files named `clarify.tmpl` were found, but references exist in configuration." There are references to these templates in documentation but the actual template files don't exist, so no deletion was necessary.

- [x] **Check and delete example templates**
  - **Action:** Check `internal/prompt/templates/examples/` for any templates related to clarify and delete if found.
  - **Depends On:** Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.4
  - **Output:** Examined all example template files in the `internal/prompt/templates/examples/` directory (basic.tmpl, bugfix.tmpl, detailed.tmpl, and feature.tmpl) and confirmed that none of them contain references to the clarify feature. No templates needed to be deleted.

- [x] **Update embed.go if necessary**
  - **Action:** If needed, update `internal/prompt/embed.go` to remove references to deleted templates (though go:embed should handle missing files gracefully).
  - **Depends On:** Delete clarify template files, Check and delete example templates
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.4
  - **Output:** Examined the `internal/prompt/embed.go` file and found that it uses wildcard patterns (`templates/*.tmpl` and `templates/examples/*.tmpl`) to embed all template files. This approach handles missing files gracefully, and no specific references to clarify template files were found. No changes were needed to the embed.go file.

- [x] **Remove clarify feature from README**
  - **Action:** Edit `README.md` to remove the "Task Clarification" feature from the Features list (line ~33).
  - **Depends On:** Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.6
  - **Output:** Removed the "Task Clarification" feature from the Features list in the README.md file.

- [x] **Remove clarify example from README**
  - **Action:** Edit `README.md` to remove the `--clarify` usage example (lines ~87-88).
  - **Depends On:** Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.6
  - **Output:** Removed the example demonstrating the `--clarify` flag usage from the README.md file.

- [x] **Remove clarify from options table in README**
  - **Action:** Edit `README.md` to remove the `--clarify` row from the Configuration Options table (line ~115).
  - **Depends On:** Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.6
  - **Output:** Removed the `--clarify` row from the Configuration Options table in the README.md file.

- [x] **Update CLI flag tests**
  - **Action:** In `cmd/architect/cli_test.go`, remove any test cases specifically validating the parsing or behavior of the `--clarify` flag.
  - **Depends On:** Remove ClarifyTask field from CliConfig struct
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.5, AC 1.8
  - **Output:** Examined the `cmd/architect/cli_test.go` file and found no test cases specifically validating the parsing or behavior of the `--clarify` flag. No changes were needed.

- [x] **Remove TestConvertConfigNoClarity**
  - **Action:** In `cmd/architect/flags_test.go`, delete the `TestConvertConfigNoClarity` test as it tests a field that will no longer exist.
  - **Depends On:** Remove clarify key-value pair from ConvertConfigToMap
  - **AC Ref:** AC 1.5, AC 1.8
  - **Output:** Removed the `TestConvertConfigNoClarity` test from `cmd/architect/flags_test.go` and added a new `TestConvertConfigBasic` test to ensure basic functionality of the ConvertConfigToMap function is still being tested.
