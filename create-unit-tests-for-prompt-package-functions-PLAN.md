# Create unit tests for prompt package functions

## Task Goal
Create comprehensive unit tests for the prompt.go functions to verify template handling and ensure all functionality works correctly, with a focus on testing the behavior of the public interface.

## Implementation Approach
I'll focus on a behavior-driven testing approach that emphasizes testing the public interface of the PromptBuilder without excessive mocking of internals. The tests will cover:

1. **Core functionality tests** - Test each public method of the PromptBuilder interface with both happy path and error cases
2. **Integration with prompt.ManagerInterface** - Use mock implementations where necessary to verify correct interaction
3. **File I/O** - Create temporary files and directories to test actual reading and writing behaviors

This approach prioritizes testing actual behavior over implementation details, which aligns with the project's testing philosophy of "Testing behavior over implementation".

## Reasoning
There are two main approaches I considered:

### Option 1: Heavy Mocking Approach
- Mock all dependencies (prompt.ManagerInterface, config.ManagerInterface, logutil.LoggerInterface)
- Test only the interactions between components
- Focus on verifying method calls and parameter passing

### Option 2: Behavior Testing with Limited Mocking
- Use real temporary files and directories where possible
- Mock only external APIs that cannot be easily tested (like prompt.ManagerInterface)
- Verify actual behaviors and outputs
- Test both happy paths and error handling

I've selected Option 2 because:

1. It better aligns with the TESTING_PHILOSOPHY.md principles, particularly "Behavior Over Implementation" and "Minimize Mocking"
2. It will catch actual issues with file handling, path resolution, and template processing
3. It creates tests that are less brittle to implementation changes since they verify behavior rather than specific interactions
4. It strikes a good balance between thorough testing and maintainability

The approach will require careful setup and teardown of test environments, but will result in more valuable and robust tests.
