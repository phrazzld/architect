# Task: Update `fileutil` Tests (`internal/fileutil/context_test.go`)

## Goal
Update the existing tests for the `GatherProjectContext` function to properly validate the new implementation that returns a slice of `FileMeta` structs instead of a formatted string. The tests should verify that the correct files are included/excluded based on filters, that file content is preserved correctly, and that the file count is accurate.

## Implementation Approach
After examining the current state of the tests, I've determined that they have already been updated to work with the new `FileMeta`-based implementation during the previous task (Refactor `GatherProjectContext`). However, I'll make the following improvements to enhance test coverage:

1. **Add Tests for Content Validation**:
   - Add tests that verify the actual content of the files in the `FileMeta` slice matches the expected content from the test fixtures
   - This adds a deeper level of validation beyond just checking file paths

2. **Add Tests for Path Normalization**:
   - Add tests that verify the full paths in the returned `FileMeta` structs are correctly normalized/absolute
   - Ensures consistent path handling regardless of how paths are provided

3. **Add Order Verification (when applicable)**:
   - Add a test case that verifies files are processed in the expected order when specific paths are provided
   - This is important to ensure deterministic behavior

4. **Add Edge Case Tests**:
   - Test with empty paths array
   - Test with a mix of files and directories
   - Test with paths containing symbolic links (if supported by the platform)

5. **Enhance Existing Tests**:
   - Improve existing tests by adding more descriptive error messages
   - Add comments explaining the purpose of each test case

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Alternative 1: Complete Rewrite of Tests
One approach would be to completely rewrite the tests from scratch. However, this would be unnecessary duplication since the tests have already been updated to work with the new implementation. The planned enhancements build on the existing structure while adding deeper validation.

### Alternative 2: Minimal Approach
Another approach would be to just clean up the existing tests without adding new test cases. However, this would miss the opportunity to improve test coverage and ensure the robustness of the implementation.

## Key Reasoning
1. **Enhanced Test Coverage**: The proposed approach adds deeper validation of file content and path handling, which increases confidence in the implementation.

2. **Reuse of Working Tests**: Since the basic tests for the updated implementation already exist, it's more efficient to build on them rather than starting from scratch.

3. **Strategic Focus**: The approach focuses on the most important aspects to test: content fidelity, path handling, filtering logic, and edge cases.

4. **Maintainability**: Adding clear comments and error messages makes the tests more maintainable for future developers.

5. **Adherence to Plan**: This approach aligns with the project's refactoring plan by ensuring proper validation of the new data structures and interfaces.
