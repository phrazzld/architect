# Task: Update Integration Tests If Needed

## Task Details
- **Action:** Modify any integration tests that may be affected by the refactoring.
- **Depends On:** All components extracted and working.
- **AC Ref:** Implementation Steps 8, Testing Strategy 3.

## Current Project State
The project has undergone a significant refactoring process where functionality from the original main.go has been extracted into separate components:
1. Token management (token.go)
2. API client functionality (api.go)
3. Context gathering (context.go)
4. Prompt building (prompt.go)
5. Output handling (output.go)

These components have been moved to the cmd/architect/ package, and a new simplified main.go entry point has been created that delegates to cmd/architect.Main().

## Task Requirements
1. Review existing integration tests to identify any that may be broken by the refactoring
2. Update the integration tests to work with the refactored code structure
3. Ensure tests maintain their original verification purpose while working with the new architecture
4. Follow the project's testing philosophy, particularly focusing on testing behavior rather than implementation details

## Request for Implementation Approaches
Please provide 2-3 different approaches for updating the integration tests to work with the refactored code. For each approach, include:

1. A description of the implementation strategy
2. The pros and cons of the approach 
3. How the approach aligns with the project standards:
   - Core principles of simplicity and modularity (CORE_PRINCIPLES.md)
   - Architectural patterns and separation of concerns (ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md)
   - Coding conventions and practices (CODING_STANDARDS.md)
   - Testability principles minimizing mocks (TESTING_STRATEGY.md)
   - Documentation approaches for design decisions (DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md)

Please recommend the approach that best aligns with the project's standards and would be most maintainable in the long term.
