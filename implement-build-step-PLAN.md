# Implement build step

## Goal
Add a step to the build job in the GitHub Actions workflow that builds the Go project and produces the 'architect' binary.

## Implementation Approach
Update the build job in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to add a new step after the Go environment setup:

1. Add a clearly named step for building the project
2. Use the `go build` command with appropriate flags for an optimized production build
3. Ensure the binary is named 'architect' as specified in the requirements
4. Add appropriate timeout and error handling

## Reasoning

1. **Standard Go build command**: Using `go build` is the standard way to build Go applications. Since we've confirmed the binary name should be 'architect', we'll use the `-o` flag to specify the output name.

2. **Build flags for optimization**: Adding optimization flags like `-ldflags="-s -w"` helps reduce the binary size by stripping debug information. This is a common practice for production builds in CI systems.

3. **Verbose output**: Using the `-v` flag provides more detailed output during the build process, which is helpful for CI logs and debugging if issues occur.

4. **Timing and resource considerations**: Adding a timeout to the build step ensures the workflow doesn't hang indefinitely if there are issues with the build process. This is a best practice for CI workflows to prevent wasted resources.
