# Task: Define FileMeta Struct (`internal/fileutil/fileutil.go`)

**Completed:** April 10, 2025

## Summary
Added the FileMeta struct to the internal/fileutil package to support the refactoring from template-based to instructions-based approach. The struct is simple and contains just the path and content fields, which will be used in the next task to refactor the GatherProjectContext function.

## Implementation Details
- Added a new struct definition to `internal/fileutil/fileutil.go`:
  ```go
  // FileMeta represents a file with its path and content.
  type FileMeta struct {
      Path    string
      Content string
  }
  ```
- Ran all necessary checks (go fmt, go vet, go test) to ensure the implementation is valid
- Created a plan document explaining the implementation approach and reasoning

## Next Steps
The next task is to refactor the GatherProjectContext function to use this new struct type.
