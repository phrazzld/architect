# Task: Update `fileutil` Tests (`internal/fileutil/context_test.go`)

**Completed:** April 10, 2025

## Summary
Enhanced the tests for the `GatherProjectContext` function to verify the new FileMeta-based implementation. Added tests to verify file content fidelity, file order preservation, path normalization, and edge cases, while also improving the existing tests with better documentation and validation.

## Implementation Details
- Enhanced existing tests by adding descriptive comments and improving verifications
- Added `TestFileMetaContent` that validates the actual content of files is correctly preserved
- Added `TestFileOrderPreservation` to verify input file order is maintained in the output
- Added `TestEmptyAndEdgeCases` to validate behavior with empty paths, mixed contents, and invalid paths
- Added `TestPathNormalization` to ensure paths in the output are always absolute
- Fixed an issue where relative paths weren't being converted to absolute paths in the `processFile` function
- Improved the `TestFileCollector` test to verify that the same files are present in both the collector and the FileMeta result

## Next Steps
The next task is to implement the Prompt Stitching Logic, which will use the FileMeta structs to format the context for the LLM prompt.
