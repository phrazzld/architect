# Add task clarification process logging

## Task Goal
Add structured audit logging to the task clarification workflow in the architect tool. This will provide visibility into the interactive process of refining the user's task description through AI-generated questions and user answers, enhancing debugging, monitoring, and auditing capabilities.

## Implementation Approach

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified that the task clarification process is primarily handled in the `clarifyTaskDescriptionWithPromptManager` function in `main.go`. The process has several key phases that should be logged:

1. **Initialization**: Log when the task clarification process begins
2. **API Requests**: Log when requests are sent to the Gemini API for analysis and questions
3. **Response Handling**: Log the AI's analysis and number of questions generated
4. **User Interaction**: Log each question and user answer (without including sensitive information)
5. **Task Refinement**: Log the refinement request and response
6. **Completion**: Log the successful completion of the clarification process

### Implementation Details:

1. **Verify current logging structure**: Ensure the `clarifyTaskDescriptionWithPromptManager` function already accepts and uses the audit logger parameter (it should, based on the previous "Update key function signatures" task)

2. **Add structured logging** at key points in the workflow:
   - Add logging at the start of the clarification process
   - Add logging before/after each API call
   - Add logging for each question/answer interaction
   - Add logging for the refined task result

3. **Use standardized event types**:
   - `TaskClarificationStart`: When the process begins
   - `APIRequest`: Before making API calls
   - `TaskAnalysisComplete`: When task analysis is received
   - `UserClarification`: When user provides answers
   - `TaskRefinementComplete`: When refinement is completed
   - `TaskClarificationComplete`: When the entire process is finished

4. **Include appropriate metadata** in each event:
   - Input task description (with potential PII/sensitive data considerations)
   - Number of questions generated
   - Key points identified
   - Process timing information

### Alternative Approaches Considered:

1. **Minimal Logging**: Only log the start and end of the process with basic details
   - Pros: Simplicity, smaller log files
   - Cons: Limited visibility into the process, harder to debug specific issues

2. **Comprehensive Logging with full content**: Log the complete text of all interactions
   - Pros: Full visibility into all aspects of the process
   - Cons: Potential privacy concerns with user inputs, very large log files

3. **Selected Approach - Balanced Structured Logging**: Log key events with relevant metadata
   - Pros: Good visibility into the process flow while managing log size
   - Cons: Still requires careful consideration of what data to include

### Reasoning for Selected Approach:

I chose the balanced structured logging approach because:

1. It aligns with the existing audit logging pattern established in other parts of the system (e.g., configuration loading)
2. It provides sufficient information for monitoring and debugging without excessive verbosity
3. It follows best practices for structured logging by focusing on significant events and their metadata
4. It's consistent with the audit logging API design established in the auditlog package

This approach allows the system to maintain a comprehensive audit trail of the clarification process while keeping logs manageable and protecting potentially sensitive user inputs.
