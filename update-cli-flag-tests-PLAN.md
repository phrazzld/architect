# Update CLI flag tests

## Goal
Remove any test cases in `cmd/architect/cli_test.go` that specifically validate the parsing or behavior of the `--clarify` flag to ensure the test suite accurately reflects the current codebase after the removal of the clarify feature.

## Implementation Approach
1. Examine the `cmd/architect/cli_test.go` file to identify any test cases that specifically test the `--clarify` flag
2. Remove or modify these test cases to remove references to the clarify feature
3. Ensure the tests still provide adequate coverage for the remaining functionality
4. Verify that all tests pass after the changes

## Reasoning
This approach directly addresses the task by removing test cases that are no longer relevant after the clarify feature has been removed from the codebase. This ensures that the test suite accurately reflects the current functionality and doesn't test features that no longer exist.

The main consideration is maintaining adequate test coverage for the remaining functionality. When removing test cases, we need to ensure that we don't inadvertently remove tests for other features or functionality that should still be tested.

Alternative approaches considered:
1. **Modify tests rather than remove them**: Instead of removing test cases entirely, we could modify them to test different functionality. However, this might not be necessary if other test cases already provide adequate coverage.

2. **Add new tests to compensate**: If removing the clarify-related tests significantly reduces test coverage, we could add new tests for other functionality. However, this goes beyond the scope of the current task.

The chosen approach focuses on removing only the tests that are specific to the clarify feature, while ensuring that the overall test coverage for the remaining functionality is maintained. This ensures that the test suite remains effective at validating the behavior of the codebase after the clarify feature has been removed.
