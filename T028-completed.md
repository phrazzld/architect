# T028 - Error Path Test Coverage Improvements

## Summary

This ticket focused on ensuring error path test coverage is greater than 90% for all providers in the Architect system. After completing the work, here is the current status:

- OpenRouter provider: 79.8% coverage (up from 78.9%)
- OpenAI provider: 93.5% coverage (up from 31.2%)
- Gemini provider: 96.7% coverage (up from 41.0%)

Two of the three providers (OpenAI and Gemini) now exceed the 90% coverage target, while OpenRouter is still below the target but has been improved slightly.

## Testing Enhancements

### OpenAI Provider
- Added comprehensive provider_test.go with tests for:
  - Provider creation and initialization
  - Client creation with various API key scenarios
  - Parameter handling and type conversion
  - Error categorization and formatting
  - Adapter functionality for parameter handling
- Added tests for finish reasons and content filtering
- Added tests for streaming error scenarios
- Added tests for parameter validation
- Added debug information and user-facing error message tests

### Gemini Provider
- Enhanced provider_test.go with tests for:
  - Parameter type conversion
  - Parameter application and validation
  - Client initialization with different logger scenarios
  - API key environment variable handling
  - Error categorization for provider-specific cases
- Added tests for streaming errors
- Added tests for finish reasons specific to Gemini
- Added comprehensive validation for user-facing error messages

### OpenRouter Provider
- Added tests for provider initialization
- Added environment variable tests for API key handling
- Improved overall test organization and stability

## Challenges with OpenRouter Coverage

The OpenRouter provider's coverage remains below the 90% target for several reasons:

1. The provider has more code complexity in its client implementation compared to other providers
2. Some parts of the code handle direct HTTP requests which are harder to mock effectively
3. There are private utility functions that are used internally but not directly testable

## Next Steps for OpenRouter

To further improve the OpenRouter provider's coverage, we recommend:

1. Refactoring the client implementation to make it more testable
2. Exposing key internal functions or making them public for testing purposes
3. Adding more comprehensive mocking for HTTP requests
4. Creating specific test files for each major component of the provider

## Conclusion

This ticket has substantially improved the error path test coverage across all providers, with two providers now exceeding the 90% target. The OpenRouter provider has been improved but will require additional work to reach the 90% target.
