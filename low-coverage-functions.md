- `isWhitespace()` - 100% (adequately covered)
- `shouldProcess()` - 100% (adequately covered)
- `processFile()` - 85.0% (mostly covered, needs more error condition coverage)

### 4.2 mock_logger.go
- Most functions have 0% coverage
- Only `ContainsMessage()` (83.3%) and `SetVerbose()` (100%) are well covered

### 5.3 main.go
- `Main()` - 0% (completely untested)

### 5.4 output.go (0% coverage for all functions)

- `GetTokenInfo()` - 94.7% (mostly covered)
- `CheckTokenLimit()` - 100% (adequately covered)
- `PromptForConfirmation()` - 18.2% (needs substantial coverage increase)

## 6. Model Processor Package (64.2% coverage)

## Test Implementation Priorities

Based on this analysis, the following implementation priorities are recommended:

1. **First Priority**: 
   - Implement tests for all functions in `internal/gemini/errors.go` and `internal/gemini/gemini_client.go`
   - This aligns with Section 2.1-2.3 of the plan and will significantly increase coverage

2. **Second Priority**:
   - Create adapter tests in `internal/architect/adapters_test.go`
   - This aligns with Section 3 of the plan and targets code with 0% coverage

3. **Third Priority**:
   - Implement tests for `DefaultConfig()` and `ValidateConfig()` in the config package
   - This aligns with Section 4.1 of the plan

4. **Fourth Priority**:
   - Enhance tests for `isGitIgnored()` in the fileutil package
   - This aligns with Section 4.2 of the plan

5. **Fifth Priority**:
   - Complete testing for the command package, focusing on `ParseFlags()`, `SetupLogging()`, and the output functions
   - This aligns with Section 5.1 of the plan

This prioritization follows the plan's focus on addressing the most critical gaps first (gemini package at 2.3%, adapters at 0%) before moving to packages with higher existing coverage.
