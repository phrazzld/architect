# Implement golangci-lint

## Goal
Add a step to the GitHub Actions workflow that installs and runs golangci-lint for comprehensive linting of Go code.

## Implementation Approach
Update the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to add a new step in the lint job after the vet check step:

1. Use the official golangci-lint-action@v3 GitHub Action to install and run golangci-lint
2. Configure the action with the 'latest' version to ensure we get the most up-to-date linting rules
3. Keep the configuration minimal for now, without specifying a custom configuration file

## Reasoning

1. **Use of official action**: The golangci/golangci-lint-action is the official and recommended way to run golangci-lint in GitHub Actions. It handles installation, caching, and execution in an optimized way.

2. **Version selection**: Using 'latest' as the version ensures we always get the most recent version of golangci-lint with fixes and new linting rules. Alternatively, we could pin to a specific version for consistency, but for a project that's just setting up CI, starting with the latest version is reasonable.

3. **Minimal configuration**: For now, we're keeping the configuration minimal as requested in the task. In a real-world scenario, we might want to add a custom configuration file to tailor the linting rules to the project's needs, but that's outside the scope of the current task.

4. **Placement in workflow**: Running golangci-lint after the simpler go fmt and go vet checks makes sense because:
   - golangci-lint is more comprehensive and may take longer to run
   - If simpler checks fail, we can fail fast without running the more resource-intensive golangci-lint
