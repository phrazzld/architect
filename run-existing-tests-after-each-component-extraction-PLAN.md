# Run existing tests after each component extraction

## Goal
Verify all existing tests pass after moving each logical component to ensure functionality is maintained throughout the refactoring process.

## Implementation Approach
The approach will be to create a systematic test verification process that can confirm the test suite continues to pass after each component extraction. This will involve:

1. Running the full Go test suite with verbose output to identify any failing tests
2. Documenting the test results for each component extraction
3. Fixing any test failures that may have been introduced during the refactoring process

## Reasoning
This approach is preferred over alternatives (such as only running component-specific tests or delaying testing until all refactoring is complete) because:

1. It provides immediate feedback on whether each extraction maintains compatibility with existing functionality
2. It allows for incremental verification, making it easier to identify which specific extraction caused any failures
3. It aligns with the project's testing strategy of ensuring tests pass throughout the refactoring process
4. It's more comprehensive than targeted testing and will catch unexpected integration issues
