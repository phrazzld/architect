# Remove clarify flag definition

## Goal
Remove the `clarifyTaskFlag` variable definition in `cmd/architect/cli.go` to begin the process of purging the clarify feature from the codebase.

## Chosen Implementation Approach
I'll use a straightforward, targeted approach for this task:

1. First, I'll examine the context around the `clarifyTaskFlag` variable definition in `cmd/architect/cli.go` to understand how it's defined and used in the surrounding code.
2. Then, I'll perform a simple deletion of just the line where `clarifyTaskFlag` is defined, keeping the rest of the flag definitions intact.
3. I'll verify that the code compiles after the change, as this won't yet affect the subsequent use of this flag since we're only removing the definition at this stage.

## Reasoning for Approach
I chose this approach for these reasons:

* **Targeted precision over broad changes:** The task specifically calls for removing just the flag definition, not all related logic. This incremental approach aligns with the dependency structure in the TODO list, where additional related changes will follow in subsequent tasks.

* **Minimal risk:** By only removing the flag definition while leaving usage code for now, we ensure that any unforeseen dependencies aren't immediately disrupted. If compilation fails, we'll have a clear indication of what needs to be addressed first.

* **Proper sequencing:** This maintains the logical order of changes outlined in the TODO list. The `ClarifyTask` field and other usage points will be addressed in follow-up tasks that depend on this one.

Alternative approaches like removing all clarify-related code at once would be riskier and could lead to more complex debugging if something goes wrong. The incremental approach ensures we can easily isolate and fix issues at each step.
