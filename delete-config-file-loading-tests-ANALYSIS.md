# Analysis: Delete config file loading tests

## Task Description
Delete any test files specifically targeting the config file loading mechanism (e.g., `internal/config/loader_test.go` if it exists). Remove related test helper functions or fixtures.

## Files Identified for Deletion
1. `/Users/phaedrus/Development/architect/internal/config/loader_test.go`
   - This file contained tests for the configuration loader functionality, which has been removed as part of the simplification of the configuration system.
   - Tests included `TestMergeWithFlags`, `TestLoadFromFiles`, `TestAutomaticInitialization`, and `TestDisplayInitializationMessage`, all of which are no longer relevant since the file-based configuration loading mechanism has been removed.

2. `/Users/phaedrus/Development/architect/internal/config/legacy_config_test.go`
   - This file contained tests for handling legacy configuration files with specific fields.
   - The `TestLegacyConfigWithClarifyFieldsIsIgnored` test is no longer needed since we're not handling configuration files at all anymore.

## Files Retained
1. `/Users/phaedrus/Development/architect/internal/config/mock_logger_test.go`
   - This file contains a mock implementation of the logger interface used for testing.
   - The mock logger is a general testing utility that might be useful for other tests in the package, so it was kept.

## Implementation Details
Both identified test files were deleted as they are no longer relevant to the simplified configuration approach. There were no references to these test files from other parts of the codebase, so removing them didn't break any dependencies.

## Verification
After deleting the files, I verified that only the `mock_logger_test.go` file remains in the `internal/config` directory, which was our intended outcome.

This task is part of the broader effort to remove the file-based configuration system in favor of using defaults, command-line flags, and environment variables exclusively, as outlined in PLAN.md Step 9.
