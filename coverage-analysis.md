# Coverage Analysis

## Overall Coverage

The current test coverage is approximately 48.9% across the codebase. This is slightly lower than the estimated 50.7% in the plan, which may be due to not running tests for all packages because of the orchestrator test failure.

## Package Coverage Summary

### High Coverage Packages (>80%)
- `internal/architect/prompt`: 100.0%
- `internal/runutil`: 100.0%
- `internal/ratelimit`: 82.4%
- `internal/auditlog`: 80.6%

### Medium Coverage Packages (50-80%)
- `cmd/architect`: 54.0%
- `internal/fileutil`: 59.2%
- `internal/architect/modelproc`: 64.2%
- `internal/logutil`: 71.1%

### Low Coverage Packages (<50%)
- `internal/gemini`: 2.3%
- `internal/config`: 33.3%
- `internal/architect/interfaces`: 0% (no tests)
- `internal/architect/adapters.go`: 0% (no tests)

## Critical Areas Requiring Tests

### 1. Gemini Package (2.3% coverage)
- **`errors.go`**: All functions (0% coverage)
  - `Error()`, `Unwrap()`, `UserFacingError()`, `DebugInfo()`
  - `IsAPIError()`, `GetErrorType()`, `FormatAPIError()`
- **`gemini_client.go`**: All functions (0% coverage)
  - `newGeminiClient()`, `GenerateContent()`, `CountTokens()`, `GetModelInfo()`
  - `fetchModelInfo()`, `Close()`, `GetModelName()`, `GetTemperature()`
  - `GetMaxOutputTokens()`, `GetTopP()`, `mapSafetyRatings()`
- **`client.go`**: 
  - `NewClient()` (0% coverage)

### 2. Config Package (33.3% coverage)
- `DefaultConfig()` (0% coverage)
- `ValidateConfig()` (0% coverage)

### 3. Command Package (54.0% coverage)
- **`main.go`**: `Main()` (0% coverage)
- **`cli.go`**: 
  - `ParseFlags()` (0% coverage)
  - `SetupLogging()` (0% coverage)
- **`output.go`**:
  - `NewFileWriter()` (0% coverage)
  - `SaveToFile()` (0% coverage)
- **`token.go`**:
  - `PromptForConfirmation()` (18.2% coverage)

### 4. FileUtil Package (59.2% coverage)
- **`fileutil.go`**:
  - `isGitIgnored()` (57.9% coverage)

### 5. Mock Implementations
- Many mock implementations have 0% coverage, particularly in `internal/gemini/mock_client.go` and `internal/fileutil/mock_logger.go`

## Notable Issues During Testing

1. Found a nil pointer dereference in `internal/architect/orchestrator.TestIntegration_RateLimiting` that needs to be fixed.

## Recommendations

1. Focus initial test implementation efforts on the `internal/gemini` package, which has the lowest coverage and is critical to the application.
2. Create tests for adapter code and interfaces, which have no coverage.
3. Complete the config package coverage.
4. Improve file utility testing for edge cases.
5. Add tests for the command package output and logging functions.
6. Fix the nil pointer issue in the orchestrator tests.

These findings align with the priorities in the PLAN.md, and the detailed function-level analysis will help target specific areas for test implementation.
