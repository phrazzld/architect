# Code Coverage Analysis

## Summary

After running the full test suite with coverage analysis, the overall code coverage is currently at **68.1%**. This is below the target of 80% set in the test plan.

## Package Coverage Breakdown

| Package | Coverage | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/integration | 36.3% | ❌ Well below target |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/architect | 60.4% | ❌ Below target |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/architect/modelproc | 64.2% | ❌ Below target |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/logutil | 66.7% | ❌ Below target |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/fileutil | 69.1% | ❌ Below target |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/cmd/architect | 75.6% | ❌ Below target |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/auditlog | 80.6% | ✅ Meets target |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/gemini | 80.3% | ✅ Meets target |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/ratelimit | 82.4% | ✅ Meets target |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/architect/orchestrator | 93.5% | ✅ Exceeds target |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/architect/prompt | 100.0% | ✅ Fully covered |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/config | 100.0% | ✅ Fully covered |
| github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/runutil | 100.0% | ✅ Fully covered |

## Key Areas Needing Improvement

### 1. Integration Package (36.3%)
- Most test helper functions in `test_helpers.go` are not covered
- Configuration helpers and verification methods are completely uncovered
- Test runner methods for error cases need coverage

### 2. Architect Package (60.4%)
- API service methods (`api.go`) have 0% coverage
- Error handling in API service lacks tests
- File writing in `filewriter.go` has only 50% coverage

### 3. ModelProc Package (64.2%)
- `CheckTokenLimit` function has 0% coverage
- `PromptForConfirmation` at 50% coverage
- `GetTokenInfo` at 51.4% coverage
- `Process` method at 70.7% coverage

### 4. LogUtil Package (66.7%)
- Standard logger adapter methods have 0% coverage
- Several logger methods (Warn, Error, Fatal, etc.) are not covered

### 5. FileUtil Package (69.1%)
- Mock logger functions have 0% coverage (though these may not need test coverage as they are test helpers)

### 6. Cmd/Architect Package (75.6%)
- `ParseFlags` function has 0% coverage
- `Main` function has 0% coverage (though this is common as it's difficult to test)
- Test helper methods have 0% coverage

## Specific Low-Coverage Functions

The following functions have particularly low coverage and should be prioritized for additional tests:

1. `gemini_client.go:GenerateContent` (8.7%)
2. `architect/app.go:setupOutputDirectory` (46.2%)
3. `architect/filewriter.go:SaveToFile` (50.0%)
4. `architect/modelproc/processor.go:PromptForConfirmation` (50.0%)
5. `architect/modelproc/processor.go:GetTokenInfo` (51.4%)
6. `architect/token.go:GetTokenInfo` (51.4%)

## Test Failures

During testing, a failure was observed in the orchestrator package tests:

```
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x2 addr=0x40 pc=0x104aaba7c]

goroutine 15 [running]:
github.com/phrazzld/architect/internal/architect/modelproc.(*tokenManager).GetTokenInfo
```

This suggests there may be a bug in the modelproc tokenManager where it's trying to access a nil pointer.

## Recommendations

1. Start with adding tests for the integration package, which has the lowest coverage
2. Fix the nil pointer dereference in the orchestrator/modelproc tests
3. Add tests for key API service methods in the architect package
4. Improve coverage of core functionality like GenerateContent
5. Address the low-coverage functions identified above

Achieving 80% coverage will require significant additions to the test suite across multiple packages.
