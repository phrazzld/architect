# Test Coverage Analysis

## Overview
This document presents a detailed analysis of test coverage across critical packages in the thinktank codebase, focusing on identifying coverage gaps after recent refactoring work.

## Overall Coverage Metrics
- **Total codebase coverage: 64.3%** (against threshold of 55%)
- All packages individually meet the 55% threshold according to package-specific checks

## Critical Package Analysis

### 1. `internal/thinktank` - 18.3% Coverage
This package has by far the lowest coverage and requires immediate attention.

#### Key Gaps:
- **Adapter Layer**: Zero coverage on all adapter methods in `adapters.go`
  - `InitLLMClient` (0%)
  - `ProcessLLMResponse` (0%)
  - `GetErrorDetails` (0%)
  - All model parameter and definition methods (0%)

- **Registry API**: Recent refactoring on `registry_api.go` has left major gaps:
  - `NewRegistryAPIService` (0%) - This was recently modified for constructor injection
  - All core methods including `InitLLMClient`, `GetModelParameters`, `ProcessLLMResponse` (all 0%)
  - Error handling methods (`IsEmptyResponseError`, `IsSafetyBlockedError`, `GetErrorDetails`) (all 0%)

- **Context Handling**: `context.go` has 0% coverage on key methods:
  - `GatherContext` (0%)
  - `DisplayDryRunInfo` (0%)

- **Orchestration**: `orchestrator.go` has no coverage:
  - `NewOrchestrator` (0%)

#### High-Priority Testing Targets:
1. `registry_api.go` - Recently refactored code needs immediate test coverage
2. `adapters.go` - Core adapter interfaces have zero coverage
3. `context.go` - Context gathering logic is untested

### 2. `internal/providers` - 86.2% Overall Coverage

#### Key Gaps:
- **OpenRouter Provider**:
  - `min` helper function (0%) in `provider.go`
  - Error handling in `client.go` and `errors.go` has some weak spots (~70%)
  - `SanitizeURL` and `GetBaseURLLogInfo` both at 66.7%

- **OpenAI Provider**: Generally good coverage, minor gaps:
  - `CreateClient` (89.5%)
  - `GenerateContent` (95.5%)

#### Medium-Priority Testing Targets:
1. OpenRouter error handling paths
2. OpenRouter URL sanitization logic

### 3. `internal/registry` - 80.9% Coverage

#### Key Gaps:
- **Provider Registry**: New code added in `provider_registry.go` has no coverage:
  - `NewProviderRegistry` (0%)
  - `RegisterProvider` (0%)
  - `GetProvider` (0%)

- **Manager**:
  - `SetGlobalManagerForTesting` (0%)
  - `Initialize` (43.5%)
  - `installDefaultConfig` (46.2%)

#### High-Priority Testing Targets:
1. `provider_registry.go` - Recently added code needs immediate test coverage
2. Manager initialization and configuration logic

### 4. `internal/llm` - 87.6% Coverage

#### Key Gaps:
- **Error Handling**:
  - `Error` and `Category` methods in `errors.go` (0%)
  - `CreateStandardErrorWithMessage` (48.1%)

#### Low-Priority Testing Targets:
1. Error message formatting and categorization

## Recommendations for T022

### High Priority
1. Write tests for `internal/thinktank/registry_api.go` focusing on the recently refactored constructor injection
2. Create tests for `internal/registry/provider_registry.go` to cover the new provider registry implementation
3. Add tests for adapter methods in `internal/thinktank/adapters.go` which have 0% coverage

### Medium Priority
1. Add tests for error handling in `internal/providers/openrouter`
2. Improve coverage of manager initialization in `internal/registry/manager.go`

### Low Priority
1. Add tests for error handling classes in `internal/llm/errors.go`

## Conclusion
The most critical gap is in the `internal/thinktank` package where coverage is extremely low (18.3%). Recent refactoring work in `registry_api.go` and `provider_registry.go` has left significant functionality untested. These areas should be the primary focus for the next phase of test implementation.
