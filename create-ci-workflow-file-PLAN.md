# Create CI workflow file

## Goal
Create the main `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file with the basic structure and trigger events for the master branch.

## Implementation Approach
Create a YAML file with the following structure:
1. A meaningful name for the workflow
2. Trigger events specifically for:
   - Push events to the master branch
   - Pull request events targeting the master branch
3. Jobs section with placeholder jobs that will be filled in by subsequent tasks:
   - lint job (placeholder)
   - test job (placeholder)
   - build job (placeholder)

## Reasoning
1. **Incremental approach**: Create the basic structure first, with placeholders for jobs that will be implemented in subsequent tasks. This allows us to build the workflow incrementally while maintaining a valid YAML file at each step.

2. **Use YAML comments**: Add comments to indicate where future tasks will add functionality, making it clear to other developers (and for our own reference) what needs to be added in the future.

3. **Follow GitHub Actions best practices**: Structure the file according to GitHub Actions conventions, with well-named sections and clear organization.

4. **Target master branch**: As specified in the clarifications, the workflow should target the master branch, not main.
