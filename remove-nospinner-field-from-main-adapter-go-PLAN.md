# Remove NoSpinner field from main_adapter.go

## Task Goal
Remove the `NoSpinner` boolean field from the `Configuration` struct definition in internal/integration/main_adapter.go to align it with the changes already made to the main.go Configuration struct.

## Implementation Approach
I will use a comprehensive approach to ensure all usages are properly removed:

1. Remove the `NoSpinner` field from the `Configuration` struct definition in main_adapter.go
2. Remove the declaration and usage of the `noSpinnerFlag` flag in the `parseFlags` function
3. Remove the assignment of flag value to `config.NoSpinner` in the `parseFlags` function
4. Verify tests still pass after making these changes

## Reasoning for Selected Approach
I considered three potential approaches:

1. **Field Removal Only**: Just remove the NoSpinner field from the Configuration struct without addressing the flag and assignment in parseFlags. This would be incomplete and result in compilation errors.

2. **Mark as Deprecated**: Keep the field but mark it as deprecated with a comment. This is not aligned with the project's goal of completely removing spinner functionality.

3. **Comprehensive Removal (Selected)**: Remove both the field definition and all related code in parseFlags to keep the codebase in sync with main.go. This is the most thorough approach.

I've chosen the third option because:

1. It ensures complete removal of the spinner functionality in keeping with the other tasks already completed
2. It maintains consistency between main.go and main_adapter.go, which is essential since the comment on the Configuration struct explicitly states it "needs to be kept in sync with the main package"
3. It prevents any runtime errors or compilation issues that might occur from partial removal
4. It follows the pattern established in previous tasks where both the field and its usages were systematically removed

This approach is straightforward and the safest way to ensure that the adapter remains consistent with the main package configuration structure.
