# Remove conditional clarify logic from execution flow

## Goal
Remove any conditional logic or function calls related to the `clarify` feature from the execution flow in `internal/architect/app.go` while ensuring that the standard execution path remains intact and functional.

## Implementation Approach
1. Examine the `internal/architect/app.go` file to identify any `if cliConfig.ClarifyTask` conditional blocks or other clarify-related logic
2. Remove the identified conditional blocks or function calls while preserving the standard execution path
3. Ensure any necessary code from within these blocks that is part of the standard flow is retained
4. If needed, simplify the execution flow after removing conditional branches
5. Verify that the application still compiles and functions correctly
6. Run tests to confirm that the execution flow works properly without the clarify feature

## Reasoning
This approach directly addresses the task by analyzing and removing the conditional clarify logic while carefully preserving the main execution flow. By examining the `app.go` file, we can identify and surgically remove only the clarify-specific code without disrupting the core functionality.

Alternative approaches considered:
1. **Refactor the entire execution flow**: This would involve a more comprehensive rewrite of the execution logic, which could improve the code but carries higher risk of introducing bugs and is beyond the scope of the current task, which is focused specifically on removing clarify functionality.

2. **Comment out the clarify logic instead of removing it**: While this approach would make it easier to revert changes if needed, it would leave dead code in the codebase, which violates the goal of completely purging the clarify feature.

The chosen approach is the most direct and aligns with the overall project goal of removing the clarify feature while minimizing risk. By focusing only on removing the clarify-specific logic and preserving the standard execution path, we ensure that the application continues to function correctly while achieving the task's objective.
