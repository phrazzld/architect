# Review and Update `architect.CliConfig` Struct

## Task Title
Review and update `architect.CliConfig` struct

## Implementation Approach
Compare the current `architect.CliConfig` struct in `internal/architect/types.go` with the simplified `AppConfig` in `internal/config/config.go` and the `CliConfig` in `cmd/architect/cli.go` to ensure it contains all necessary fields for configuration after removing the file-based config system.
