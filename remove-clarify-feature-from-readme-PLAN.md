# Remove clarify feature from README

## Goal
Remove the "Task Clarification" feature from the Features list in the README.md file to ensure the documentation accurately reflects the current capabilities of the codebase after the removal of the clarify feature.

## Implementation Approach
1. Locate the Features list in the README.md file around line 33
2. Remove the line that mentions "Task Clarification" from this list
3. Ensure the formatting and numbering of the list remains consistent
4. Verify that the removal doesn't disrupt the overall structure or readability of the document

## Reasoning
This straightforward approach directly addresses the task by removing the reference to the clarify feature from the README.md file. Since this is a simple documentation update, there are no complex implementation alternatives to consider.

The only consideration is maintaining the formatting and structure of the README document after the removal. Since Markdown list items are typically formatted with hyphens or numbers, removing one item shouldn't disrupt the overall structure as long as we don't inadvertently modify adjacent text.

This task is an important part of ensuring that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the application. Users reading the README should not be led to believe that the clarify feature is available when it has been removed from the codebase.
