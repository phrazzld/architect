# Delete internal/spinner directory

## Task Goal
Remove the entire internal/spinner directory, including spinner.go and any other files within it. This is part of the ongoing spinner removal process, where all direct usage of the spinner has already been replaced with logging calls.

## Implementation Approach
I will use a two-step approach to safely delete the spinner directory:

1. **Verify All References Are Removed**:
   - Double-check that no code still directly imports or references the spinner package
   - Verify that all usages of the spinner have been replaced with logging functionality
   - Confirm that the spinner package can be safely removed without breaking existing functionality

2. **Delete the Directory**:
   - Use `git rm -r` to delete the directory and stage the changes in git
   - Run tests to verify that the removal doesn't break anything
   - Update the TODO.md to mark the task as complete

## Reasoning for Selected Approach
I considered three potential approaches:

1. **Direct Deletion Without Verification**: Simply delete the internal/spinner directory and run tests to see if anything breaks. This would be the quickest approach but risks missing subtle dependencies.

2. **Gradual Deprecation**: Mark the package as deprecated, leave it in place temporarily with internal warnings, then remove it later. This would allow for a more gradual transition but doesn't align with the project's current approach of direct removal.

3. **Verification and Deletion (Selected)**: Carefully verify that all references are removed before actually deleting the directory. This balances safety with efficiency.

I've chosen the third approach because:
- It provides the highest level of confidence that we're not breaking anything
- It aligns with the methodical approach taken so far in the spinner removal process
- Based on the dependency analysis, it appears that the spinner package is no longer imported elsewhere in the codebase, making it safe to delete
- The risk of complications is low since all previous spinner replacement tasks have been completed successfully

This approach ensures that we properly clean up the codebase without introducing regressions, while keeping the process simple and straightforward.
