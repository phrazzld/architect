# Task: Identify all spinner usage in main.go

## Goal
Scan main.go to document all instances of `spinnerInstance` usage, including their locations and specific patterns. This documentation will ensure complete and accurate replacement of spinner functionality with logging in subsequent tasks.

## Chosen Implementation Approach
I'll use a systematic approach to document all spinner usage in main.go:

1. Grep for all instances of `spinnerInstance` in main.go to locate all spinner usage
2. For each instance found:
   - Document the line number and function context
   - Identify the specific spinner method being called (Start, Stop, StopFail, UpdateMessage)
   - Note the message being passed
   - Document any patterns/special cases (such as debug-level logging)
3. Create a structured document that categorizes the spinner usage by method type
4. Identify any related code that might be affected when these spinner calls are replaced

## Reasoning for Approach
This approach provides a comprehensive, organized record of spinner usage that will serve as a reference for subsequent tasks. By documenting not just occurrences but also context and patterns, we ensure nothing is missed during the replacement process. This is particularly important because simply doing a find/replace could miss subtle patterns or context-specific behavior.

The structured categorization by method type directly aligns with the follow-up tasks, which are organized by spinner method (Start/Stop, UpdateMessage, StopFail). Having this information clearly documented will make those tasks more straightforward and reduce the risk of error.

This approach doesn't modify any code yet, so it's inherently low-risk while providing high value for the subsequent implementation tasks.
