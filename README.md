# Architect

A powerful code-base context analysis and planning tool that leverages Google's Gemini AI to generate detailed, actionable technical plans for software projects.

## Overview

Architect analyzes your codebase and uses Gemini AI to create comprehensive technical plans for new features, refactoring, bug fixes, or any software development task. By understanding your existing code structure and patterns, Architect provides contextually relevant guidance tailored to your specific project.

## Important Update: Instruction Input Method

**Please note:** The way you provide instructions to Architect has changed:

* The `--instructions` flag is now **required** for generating plans. You must provide the instructions in a file. This allows for more complex and structured inputs.
* The `--task-file` flag has been **removed** and replaced with the `--instructions` flag.
* For `--dry-run` operations, the `--instructions` flag is optional. You can run a simple dry run with just `architect --dry-run ./` to see which files would be included.

Please update your workflows accordingly. See the Usage examples and Configuration Options below for details.

## Features

- **Contextual Analysis**: Analyzes your codebase to understand its structure, patterns, and dependencies
- **Smart Filtering**: Include/exclude specific file types or directories from analysis
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Leverages Google's powerful Gemini models for intelligent planning
- **Customizable Output**: Configure the format of the generated plan
- **Git-Aware**: Respects .gitignore patterns when scanning your codebase
- **Token Management**: Smart token counting with limit checking to prevent API errors
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview which files would be included and see token statistics before API calls
- **XML-Structured Approach**: Uses a simple XML structure for instructions and context
- **Instructions File Input**: Load instructions from external files
- **Structured Logging**: Clear, structured logs with configurable verbosity levels
- **Interactive Progress**: Visual spinner indicates progress during API calls
- **User Confirmation**: Optional confirmation for large token counts

## Installation

```bash
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/architect.git
cd architect
go build

# Install globally
go install
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage (Instructions in instructions.txt)
architect --instructions instructions.txt path/to/your/project

# Example: Create a plan using an instructions file (e.g., auth_instructions.txt)
# Contents of auth_instructions.txt: "Implement JWT-based user authentication and authorization"
architect --instructions auth_instructions.txt ./

# Specify output file (default is PLAN.md)
architect --instructions instructions.txt --output auth_plan.md ./

# Include only specific file extensions
architect --instructions instructions.txt --include .go,.md ./

# Use a different Gemini model
architect --instructions instructions.txt --model gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 ./

# Dry run to see which files would be included (without generating a plan)
architect --dry-run ./

# Dry run with instructions file
architect --dry-run --instructions instructions.txt ./

# Request confirmation before proceeding if token count exceeds threshold
architect --instructions instructions.txt --confirm-tokens 25000 ./
```

### Required Environment Variable

```bash
# Set your Gemini API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Configuration Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--instructions` | Path to a file containing the instructions (Required unless --dry-run is used) | `(Required)` |
| `--output` | Output file path for the generated plan | `PLAN.md` |
| `--model` | Gemini model to use for generation | `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` |
| `--verbose` | Enable verbose logging output (shorthand for --log-level=debug) | `false` |
| `--log-level` | Set logging level (debug, info, warn, error) | `info` |
| `--include` | Comma-separated list of file extensions to include | (All files) |
| `--exclude` | Comma-separated list of file extensions to exclude | (Common binary and media files) |
| `--exclude-names` | Comma-separated list of file/dir names to exclude | (Common directories like .git, node_modules) |
| `--format` | Format string for each file. Use {path} and {content} | `<{path}>\n```\n{content}\n```\n</{path}>\n\n` |
| `--dry-run` | Show files that would be included and token count, but don't call the API | `false` |
| `--confirm-tokens` | Prompt for confirmation if token count exceeds this value (0 = never prompt) | `0` |

## Configuration Files

Architect follows the XDG Base Directory Specification for configuration files, looking for settings in standardized locations across platforms.

### Configuration File Locations

- **User configuration**: `~/.config/architect/config.toml` (Linux/macOS) or `%APPDATA%\architect\config.toml` (Windows)
- **System configuration**: `/etc/xdg/architect/config.toml` (Linux) or system-wide locations on other platforms

### Automatic Configuration Initialization

Architect automatically creates necessary configuration directories and files the first time you run any command:

- No explicit initialization command is needed
- User configuration directory (`~/.config/architect/`) is created automatically
- Default configuration file is generated with sensible defaults

When automatic initialization occurs, you'll see a message like this:

```
âœ“ Architect configuration initialized automatically.
  Created default configuration file at: /home/user/.config/architect/config.toml
  Applying default settings:
    - Output File: PLAN.md
    - Model: gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25
    - Log Level: info
  You can customize these settings by editing the file.
```

This message only appears the first time you run the tool, or if your configuration file is deleted.

### Configuration Format

Architect uses TOML as its configuration format. Example configuration:

```toml
# General configuration
output_file = "PLAN.md"
model = "gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25"
log_level = "info"
use_colors = true

# File exclusion patterns
[excludes]
extensions = ".exe,.bin,.o,.jar"
names = ".git,node_modules,vendor"
```

For a complete example with all available options, see the [example configuration file](internal/config/example_config.toml).

### Configuration Precedence

Settings are loaded with the following precedence (highest to lowest):
1. Command-line flags
2. User configuration file
3. System configuration files
4. Default values


## Token Management

Architect implements intelligent token management to prevent API errors and optimize context:

- **Accurate Token Counting**: Uses Gemini's API to get precise token counts for your content
- **Pre-API Validation**: Checks token count against model limits before making API calls
- **Fail-Fast Strategy**: Provides clear error messages when token limits would be exceeded
- **Token Statistics**: Shows token usage as a percentage of the model's limit
- **Optional Confirmation**: Can prompt for confirmation when token count exceeds a threshold

When token limits are exceeded, try:
1. Limiting file scope with `--include` or additional filtering flags
2. Using a model with a higher token limit
3. Splitting your task into smaller, more focused requests

## Generated Plan Structure

The generated PLAN.md includes:

1. **Overview**: Brief explanation of the task and changes involved
2. **Task Breakdown**: Detailed list of specific tasks with effort estimates
3. **Implementation Details**: Guidance for complex tasks with code snippets
4. **Potential Challenges**: Identified risks, edge cases, and dependencies
5. **Testing Strategy**: Approach for verifying the implementation
6. **Open Questions**: Ambiguities needing clarification


## XML-Structured Approach

Architect uses a simple XML structure to organize instructions and context:

1. Instructions are wrapped in `<instructions>...</instructions>` tags 
2. Context files are wrapped in `<context>...</context>` tags
3. Each file in the context is formatted with its path and content
4. All XML special characters in file content are properly escaped

This approach provides a clear separation between the instructions and the codebase context, making it easier for the LLM to understand and process the input.

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly in your environment
- Check that your API key has appropriate permissions for the model you're using

### Token Limit Errors
- Use `--dry-run` to see token statistics without making API calls
- Reduce the number of files analyzed with `--include` or other filtering flags
- Try a model with a higher token limit

### Performance Tips
- Start with small, focused parts of your codebase and gradually include more
- Use `--include` to target only relevant file types for your task
- Set `--log-level=debug` for detailed information about the analysis process

### Common Issues
- **Running from different directories**: Architect uses XDG config paths, not project-relative configs
- **No files processed**: Check paths and filters; use `--dry-run` to see what would be included
- **Configuration file not created**: If the automatic initialization fails to create the configuration file (e.g., due to permission issues), the tool will still run with default settings in memory
- **Custom configuration lost**: If you accidentally delete your configuration file, a new default one will be created on the next run; consider backing up your custom settings
- **Unexpected default values**: If some settings are using defaults unexpectedly, check for typos in your config file as TOML requires exact field names
