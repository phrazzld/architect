# Create basic package structure for auditlog

## Goal
Create the new `internal/auditlog` directory and set up initial package files to establish the foundation for implementing structured logging in the architect tool.

## Implementation Approach
I'll create a simple, minimal package structure with the following key components:

1. Create the `internal/auditlog` directory
2. Create an initial `doc.go` file with package documentation
3. Set up empty `event.go` and `logger.go` files with package declarations
4. Create an empty `auditlog_test.go` file for future tests

This approach provides a clean foundation for the structured logging implementation while following Go package conventions.

## Reasoning
I chose this minimalist approach for several reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Creating empty files with clear naming conventions establishes the package structure and enforces separation of concerns from the beginning (events vs. logger implementation).

2. **Go Conventions**: Following standard Go package structure with a `doc.go` file for package-level documentation adheres to Go best practices.

3. **Testability**: Including an empty test file upfront establishes the expectation that this package will be thoroughly tested.

4. **Simplicity**: Since this is just the initial structure setup, keeping it minimal and focused makes sense. The specific implementation details will be added in subsequent tasks.

5. **Foundation for Future Tasks**: This structure directly aligns with the subsequent tasks in the TODO list, providing clear locations for the AuditEvent struct, StructuredLogger interface, and their implementations.
