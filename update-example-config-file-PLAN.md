# Update example config file

## Goal
Remove the now-obsolete clarify feature configuration entries from the example configuration file to ensure users don't attempt to use removed functionality and to maintain consistency with the codebase.

## Implementation Approach
1. Open the `internal/config/example_config.toml` file
2. Remove the `clarify_task = false` line from the general configuration section
3. Remove the `clarify = "clarify.tmpl"` line from the [templates] section
4. Remove the `refine = "refine.tmpl"` line from the [templates] section
5. Maintain proper formatting and comments in the file
6. Ensure all other configuration options remain intact
7. Verify the file still follows TOML syntax and maintains consistent style with the rest of the comments and entries

## Reasoning
This direct approach is the most straightforward way to achieve the goal. By simply removing the specified lines while preserving all other content and formatting, we minimize the risk of introducing errors while still removing all references to the deprecated clarify feature.

Alternative approaches considered:
1. **Regenerate the entire example config file**: This would involve creating a completely new example configuration file based on the current code. While this would ensure perfect alignment with the codebase, it might introduce unintended changes to documentation or examples that are intentionally included in the file.

2. **Comment out the lines instead of removing them**: This would preserve the history of the configuration options but mark them as not available. However, this could confuse users who might still try to use these options, and it doesn't fulfill the goal of completely removing the clarify feature from the codebase.

The chosen approach strikes the right balance between completeness (removing all obsolete references) and safety (minimizing changes to the file structure). It directly aligns with the task requirements while maintaining the integrity of the configuration file format and its documentation value.
