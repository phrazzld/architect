# Task: Add fileIsTemplate detection mechanism

## Background
This task is part of improving the template processing functionality in the architect tool. The previous task "Update generateAndSavePlanWithPromptManager function" has already been completed, which modified the function to handle task file content as either a template or raw content based on content inspection.

## Task Details
- **Action:** Implement logic to determine if a file should be processed as a template (with variable substitution) or used as raw content.
- **Depends On:** Update generateAndSavePlanWithPromptManager function (completed)
- **AC Ref:** Template processing decision (Technical Risk 3, Open Question 1)

## Requirements
We need to develop a reliable mechanism to detect whether a file should be processed as a Go template. This detection should be:
1. Consistent with the current implementation
2. Reliable across different file types and contents
3. Well-tested with unit tests
4. Properly integrated with the existing codebase

## Request
Please provide 2-3 implementation approaches for this task, including:
1. A detailed description of each approach
2. Pros and cons of each approach
3. A recommended approach based on the project's standards and testability principles
4. Specific files that would need to be modified
5. A high-level implementation plan

The detection mechanism should build upon what was already implemented in the "Update generateAndSavePlanWithPromptManager function" task, which likely includes some form of template detection based on content inspection.
