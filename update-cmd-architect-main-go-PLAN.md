# Update cmd/architect/main.go

## Task Goal
Expand the Main() function in cmd/architect/main.go to use all the refactored components (Token Management, API Client, Context Gathering, Prompt Building, Output Handling), gradually phasing out the original implementation.

## Implementation Approach

### Selected Approach: Incremental Package-Oriented Integration
1. Implement a more robust Main() function in cmd/architect/main.go that:
   - Leverages all the refactored components through their interfaces
   - Follows the same logical flow as the original implementation
   - Maintains backward compatibility

2. Structure the implementation in the same order as the existing process flow:
   - Parse command line flags
   - Set up logging
   - Initialize configuration system
   - Handle special subcommands
   - Validate inputs
   - Initialize API client
   - Gather context
   - Build prompt
   - Perform token checks
   - Generate and save plan

3. The core logic will:
   - Use the extracted TokenManager interface for token operations
   - Use the APIService interface for API interactions
   - Use the ContextGatherer for file gathering operations
   - Use the PromptBuilder for prompt building operations
   - Use the OutputWriter for file writing and plan generation

### Alternative Approaches Considered:

#### Alternative 1: Complete Rewrite with Component Objects
- Create a new Main() function that coordinates a complete object-oriented redesign
- Define formal interfaces for all components
- Implement dependency injection throughout
- Create new structs/objects to manage component lifecycle

**Rejected because:** While this would be cleaner from a design perspective, it represents a significant departure from the current codebase. The task specifies "gradually phasing out the original implementation," suggesting an incremental approach is preferred over a complete rewrite.

#### Alternative 2: Minimal Configuration Wrapper
- Keep Main() very thin
- Create a new Configuration object that wraps all components
- Have Main() simply create the Configuration and call a Run() method
- Move all logic to the Run() method

**Rejected because:** This approach would hide too much of the core logic in the Configuration object, making it harder to understand the program flow. It also diverges from the original implementation structure, which could introduce subtle behavioral changes.

## Implementation Reasoning

The selected approach balances several important factors:

1. **Alignment with Task Requirements**: The task explicitly calls for expanding the existing Main() function to use refactored components while "gradually phasing out the original implementation." An incremental approach that mirrors the existing flow meets this requirement.

2. **Minimized Risk**: By following the same logical flow as the original implementation, we reduce the risk of introducing subtle behavioral changes or regressions.

3. **Leverage Existing Components**: All of the needed components have already been refactored into their own files with well-defined interfaces. This approach simply integrates them together in a coherent way.

4. **Maintainability**: The resulting code will be more maintainable because it will separate concerns through the use of the refactored interfaces.

5. **Clear Program Flow**: By structuring Main() to follow the same conceptual flow as the original implementation, we preserve the logical clarity of the program while improving its structure.

This approach provides the best balance of improvement vs. risk, creating a more maintainable codebase without dramatically changing the program's behavior or structure.
