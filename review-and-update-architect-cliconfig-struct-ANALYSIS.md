# Analysis of `architect.CliConfig` Struct

## Current Implementation in `internal/architect/types.go`

```go
// CliConfig represents the command-line configuration used by the application
type CliConfig struct {
    // Instructions configuration
    InstructionsFile string

    // Output configuration
    OutputFile string
    Format     string

    // Context gathering options
    Paths        []string
    Include      string
    Exclude      string
    ExcludeNames string
    DryRun       bool
    Verbose      bool

    // API configuration
    ApiKey    string
    ModelName string

    // Token management
    ConfirmTokens int

    // Logging
    LogLevel logutil.LogLevel
}
```

## Comparison with Other Config Structs

1. **Compared with simplified `AppConfig` struct**:
   - The simplified `AppConfig` in `internal/config/config.go` contains: `OutputFile`, `ModelName`, `Format`, `Include`, `ConfirmTokens`, `Verbose`, `LogLevel`, and `Excludes`
   - The `architect.CliConfig` has equivalent fields for all of these, with `Exclude` and `ExcludeNames` handling the functionality of `Excludes.Extensions` and `Excludes.Names`

2. **Compared with `cmd.CliConfig` struct**:
   - The `cmd.CliConfig` in `cmd/architect/cli.go` contains: `InstructionsFile`, `OutputFile`, `ModelName`, `Verbose`, `LogLevel`, `Include`, `Exclude`, `ExcludeNames`, `Format`, `DryRun`, `ConfirmTokens`, `Paths`, and `ApiKey`
   - The `architect.CliConfig` already contains all of these fields

## Field Usage Analysis

Checking how these fields are used in the application:

1. All fields in `architect.CliConfig` are used in `app.go` (Execute and RunInternal functions)
2. The core functions populate a `GatherConfig` struct with fields from `CliConfig`
3. Validation of input is performed on fields from `CliConfig`

## Conclusion

The current `architect.CliConfig` struct is already properly designed to contain all necessary configuration fields that the core logic requires. No changes are needed as it already includes all fields that were previously in `AppConfig` and all fields that are in `cmd.CliConfig`.

The fields in `architect.CliConfig` will now be derived solely from defaults and flags passed down from the cmd layer, rather than from configuration files, but the struct itself already has all the needed fields to support this change in how values are obtained.
