# Remove TestConvertConfigNoClarity

## Goal
Remove the `TestConvertConfigNoClarity` test from `cmd/architect/flags_test.go` as it tests a field that no longer exists, to ensure the test suite accurately reflects the current state of the codebase.

## Implementation Approach
1. Locate and remove the entire `TestConvertConfigNoClarity` function from the `cmd/architect/flags_test.go` file
2. Ensure that removing this test doesn't break any other tests
3. Verify that the test suite still passes after the change
4. Maintain any valuable test coverage by potentially adding or modifying other tests if necessary

## Reasoning
This direct approach addresses the task by simply removing a test that is no longer relevant after the removal of the clarify feature. Since the clarify key-value pair has been removed from the ConvertConfigToMap function, a test that checks for the absence of this field is redundant and potentially confusing.

The key consideration with this approach is ensuring that removing this test doesn't leave a gap in test coverage for the ConvertConfigToMap function. However, since the test was specifically checking for the absence of a field that no longer exists in the function, its removal shouldn't affect the coverage of the actual functionality.

Alternative approaches considered:
1. **Modify the test instead of removing it**: We could repurpose the test to check for the absence of some other field. However, this would be needlessly complex and potentially confusing, as the test name would no longer reflect its purpose.

2. **Add comments explaining the test's history**: We could keep the test but add comments explaining that it's testing for the absence of a field that was once present. However, this adds clutter to the codebase without providing any real benefit.

The chosen approach is the most straightforward and aligns with the goal of completely removing references to the clarify feature from the codebase, including tests that were specifically designed to test (the absence of) clarify-related functionality.
