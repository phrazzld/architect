# Conduct comprehensive search for clarify references

## Goal
Identify all occurrences of "clarify", "ClarifyTask", and "clarifyTaskFlag" in the codebase to ensure complete removal of the clarify feature in subsequent tasks.

## Chosen Implementation Approach
I will use a multi-tiered approach to find all references to the clarify feature:

1. Use the `grep` command to perform a case-insensitive recursive search across the entire project with multiple patterns.
2. Categorize the search results by file type and component (CLI, config, core logic, templates, tests, documentation).
3. Document each reference with its file path, line number, and context to provide a clear roadmap for subsequent removal tasks.
4. Include a summary of key components that contain clarify functionality to guide the implementation of later tasks.

## Reasoning for Approach
I chose this approach over alternatives for the following reasons:

* **Comprehensive over quick:** While we could just search for exact matches of "clarify", a more thorough regex search will catch variations like "ClarifyTask", "clarifyTaskFlag", and potentially related terms.

* **Documentation-focused:** Simply running grep and proceeding with deletion would be risky. By documenting each reference with context, later tasks will have clear guidance for safe removal.

* **Categorization benefits:** Organizing findings by component type aligns with how the tasks in TODO.md are structured, making it easier to reference this information during implementation.

This approach minimizes the risk of missing references, which could lead to orphaned code, compilation errors, or runtime issues after the feature removal is complete.
