# Remove ClarifyTask field from Configuration struct in main.go

## Goal
Remove the `ClarifyTask` field from the `Configuration` struct in `main.go` as part of eliminating the clarify flag and all related code from the Architect tool.

## Chosen Approach: Direct Removal
I'll implement a direct removal approach for this task:

1. Locate the `Configuration` struct definition in `main.go` (lines 33-51)
2. Remove line 48 which contains the `ClarifyTask bool` field declaration
3. Make no additional changes at this step, focusing only on removing the field declaration

This is an atomic change that addresses just the field removal from the struct. The code will not compile immediately after this change, but subsequent tasks in TODO.md will address all references to this field.

## Reasoning for this Choice
I've chosen the direct removal approach for the following reasons:

1. **Atomicity**: This approach creates a clean, atomic change that's focused on a single logical modification, making it easy to review and test.

2. **Task Alignment**: It precisely follows the task breakdown in TODO.md, which separates field removal from updating references.

3. **Testability**: This approach is highly testable according to TESTING_PHILOSOPHY.MD:
   - It follows the "Simplicity & Clarity" principle with a straightforward removal
   - It aligns with "Testability is a Design Goal" by simplifying the Configuration struct
   - It doesn't require complex mocking or setup to test - we simply need to verify the field no longer exists

4. **Best Practices**: It adheres to the "Conventional Commits & Atomic Changes" principle from BEST_PRACTICES.md by keeping the change small and focused on a single purpose.

While this change on its own will cause compilation errors, that's expected and will be addressed by subsequent tasks. This approach maintains a clear step-by-step implementation path and makes it easier to verify each change independently.

The field removal is the first logical step in the process of removing the clarify functionality, and subsequent tasks will handle updating all references to this field to complete the removal process.
