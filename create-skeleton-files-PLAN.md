# Implementation Plan: Create skeleton files in cmd/architect/

## Task
Create the following files with proper package declarations and import statements: api.go, context.go, token.go, output.go, prompt.go.

## Goal
Establish a clean, maintainable foundation for the upcoming refactoring tasks where code from the original main.go will be moved into these specialized files.

## Chosen Approach: Interface-Driven Skeletons

I'll implement an interface-driven approach for creating the skeleton files. This approach:
1. Creates the five required files in the cmd/architect/ directory
2. Defines a clear interface in each file representing its core responsibility
3. Creates basic structs that will implement these interfaces
4. Adds constructor functions that return the interface type
5. Includes necessary imports and stub method implementations

## Reasoning for this Choice

I'm choosing the interface-driven approach primarily because it aligns perfectly with the project's testing philosophy:

1. **Behavior Over Implementation**: By defining interfaces upfront, we're making a clear statement about the behavior each component should expose, not how it's implemented internally. This will make tests less brittle to refactoring since they'll focus on the public API.

2. **Minimize Mocking**: The approach encourages proper dependency injection through constructors, making it easy to swap real implementations with test doubles only for external dependencies (like the Gemini API client).

3. **Testability as a Design Goal**: This approach makes testability a first-class consideration from the start, rather than an afterthought.

4. **Future Maintainability**: While requiring slightly more upfront work, this approach will make the subsequent refactoring tasks much clearer and more straightforward, as there will be a well-defined structure to move the existing code into.

## Implementation Details

For each file:

1. **Package Declaration**: All files will use `package architect` to match the existing files in the directory.

2. **Interfaces**: Each file will define a clear, focused interface representing its core responsibility.

3. **Struct Types**: Simple struct types will be created that will eventually implement these interfaces.

4. **Constructors**: Each file will have a constructor function that accepts necessary dependencies and returns the interface type.

5. **Method Stubs**: Empty implementations of the interface methods will be added, returning appropriate errors indicating "not implemented yet".

6. **Imports**: Include only essential imports needed for the skeleton, focusing on standard libraries and existing project types/interfaces.

The interfaces will be designed to make the dependency flow explicit and to enable thorough testing without excessive mocking.
