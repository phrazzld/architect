# CI Status Audit

## Overview

This document audits the Continuous Integration (CI) status for the `feature/dead-code-elimination` branch.

## CI System Analysis

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI with the following workflow components:
- Linting and formatting
- Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- Secret detection verification
- Coverage validation (90% threshold)
- Default model consistency checks

## Current Status

**CI is failing**

The CI for the `feature/dead-code-elimination` branch has failed in the "Test" job, specifically in the "Run E2E tests with full coverage" step.

Run ID: 14808260196
Status: Failure
Triggered: 2025-05-03T06:18:48Z
Duration: 3m17s

## Failure Analysis

The E2E tests are failing with a permission error. The following error appears for all test executions:

```
Failed to run thinktank: failed to run command: fork/exec /home/runner/work/thinktank/thinktank/thinktank: permission denied
```

The issue is that the thinktank binary is built but doesn't have executable permissions:

1. The E2E test script builds the binary: `Thinktank binary not found, building from source...`
2. The binary is created at: `/home/runner/work/thinktank/thinktank/thinktank`
3. But all test attempts to execute the binary fail with `permission denied`

## Remediation Plan

### 1. Fix executable permissions

Add the following to the E2E test script (`internal/e2e/run_e2e_tests.sh`) or modify the GitHub Actions workflow:

```bash
# After building the binary
chmod +x /home/runner/work/thinktank/thinktank/thinktank
```

The most likely places to make this change:

1. In the E2E test script:
   - Check `internal/e2e/run_e2e_tests.sh` to see where the binary is built
   - Add the `chmod +x` command immediately after the binary build step

2. Or in the GitHub workflow file:
   - Add a step before running E2E tests to ensure the binary has executable permissions:
   ```yaml
   - name: Ensure binary executable permissions
     run: chmod +x thinktank || true
   ```

### 2. Verify the fix locally

Before pushing changes:

1. Run the E2E tests locally to verify they pass:
   ```bash
   ./internal/e2e/run_e2e_tests.sh --verbose
   ```

2. Check if the binary has execute permissions locally:
   ```bash
   ls -la thinktank
   ```

## Implementation Steps

1. Examine `internal/e2e/run_e2e_tests.sh` to locate the binary build step
2. Add `chmod +x` command after the binary build
3. Test locally to verify the fix works
4. Push the changes to the branch
5. Monitor the CI to ensure it passes

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
- Ensure all build scripts explicitly set executable permissions on binaries
- Add a CI check that verifies binary permissions before running tests
