# CI Status Audit

## Overview

This document audits the Continuous Integration (CI) status for the `feature/dead-code-elimination` branch.

## CI System Analysis

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI with the following workflow components:
- Linting and formatting
- Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- Secret detection verification
- Coverage validation (90% threshold)
- Default model consistency checks

## Current Status

**CI is failing**

The CI for the `feature/dead-code-elimination` branch has failed in the "Test" job, specifically in the "Run E2E tests with full coverage" step.

Run ID: 14811004263
Status: Failure
Triggered: 2025-05-03T12:46:51Z
Duration: 3m22s

## Failure Analysis

The E2E tests initially failed with permission error:
```
Failed to run thinktank: failed to run command: fork/exec /home/runner/work/thinktank/thinktank/thinktank: permission denied
```

After fixing permissions, a new error appeared:
```
Failed to run thinktank: failed to run command: fork/exec /home/runner/work/thinktank/thinktank/thinktank: exec format error
```

The issues are:

1. The thinktank binary is built but doesn't have executable permissions.
2. The binary is built without explicitly setting the target platform, which can cause compatibility issues between local development and CI environments.

## Remediation Plan

### 1. Fix binary building process in e2e_test.go

Add the following to the `findOrBuildBinary` function in `internal/e2e/e2e_test.go`:

```go
// Ensure the binary has executable permissions
if err := os.Chmod(buildOutput, 0755); err != nil {
    return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to set executable permissions on binary: %v", err)
}

// Set explicit target platform
cmd.Env = append(os.Environ(),
    "GOOS="+runtime.GOOS,
    "GOARCH="+runtime.GOARCH,
)
```

### 2. Modify the GitHub workflow file

Add a dedicated step to build a CI-specific binary and create a symlink for E2E tests:

```yaml
# Build a CI-specific binary for E2E tests to avoid cross-platform issues
- name: Build E2E test binary
  run: |
    # Build a binary specifically for CI E2E tests
    go build -o thinktank-e2e ./cmd/thinktank
    chmod +x thinktank-e2e
  timeout-minutes: 2

# Run E2E tests with parallel execution
- name: Run E2E tests with full coverage
  run: |
    # Create a symlink so the tests find the binary at the expected location
    ln -sf $(pwd)/thinktank-e2e $(pwd)/thinktank
    chmod +x thinktank
    ./internal/e2e/run_e2e_tests.sh --verbose
  timeout-minutes: 15
```

### 3. Verify the fix locally

Before pushing changes:

1. Run the E2E tests locally to verify they pass:
   ```bash
   ./internal/e2e/run_e2e_tests.sh --verbose
   ```

2. Check if the binary has execute permissions locally:
   ```bash
   ls -la thinktank
   ```

## Implementation Steps

1. Add runtime import to e2e_test.go
2. Set explicit GOOS and GOARCH when building the binary
3. Add chmod with permission 0755 after building binary
4. Modify GitHub workflow to build a CI-specific binary
5. Test locally to verify the fix works
6. Push the changes to the branch
7. Monitor the CI to ensure it passes

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
- Always set explicit target platform (GOOS, GOARCH) when building binaries
- Use symlinks in CI to ensure binaries are found in expected locations
- Set explicit executable permissions (chmod +x) after building binaries
- Build binaries specifically for the CI environment rather than relying on tests to build them
- Add verification steps that test if binaries are executable and in the correct format
