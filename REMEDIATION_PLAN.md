# CI Status Audit

## Overview

This document audits the Continuous Integration (CI) status for the `feature/dead-code-elimination` branch.

## CI System Analysis

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI with the following workflow components:
- Linting and formatting
- Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- Secret detection verification
- Coverage validation (90% threshold)
- Default model consistency checks

## Current Status

**CI is failing**

The CI for the `feature/dead-code-elimination` branch has failed in the "Test" job, specifically in the "Run E2E tests with full coverage" step.

Run ID: 14811138552
Status: Failure
Triggered: 2025-05-03T13:05:05Z
Duration: 3m29s

## Failure Analysis

We have been encountering binary execution issues in the E2E tests:

1. Initial error: Permission denied
```
Failed to run thinktank: failed to run command: fork/exec /home/runner/work/thinktank/thinktank/thinktank: permission denied
```

2. After fixing permissions, format error:
```
Failed to run thinktank: failed to run command: fork/exec /home/runner/work/thinktank/thinktank/thinktank: exec format error
```

The issues are:

1. The thinktank binary is built but doesn't have executable permissions.
2. The binary is built without explicitly setting the target platform, which causes incompatibility between local development and CI environments.
3. The E2E test code does not properly detect when running in GitHub Actions vs local environments.

## Remediation Plan

### 1. Fix binary building process in e2e_test.go

Make the following changes to `e2e_test.go`:

```go
// Add CGO_ENABLED=0 and explicit GOOS/GOARCH
cmd.Env = append(os.Environ(),
    "GOOS="+runtime.GOOS,
    "GOARCH="+runtime.GOARCH,
    "CGO_ENABLED=0", // Disable CGO for better cross-platform compatibility
)

// Add special handling for GitHub Actions in TestMain
if isRunningInGitHubActions() {
    fmt.Println("Running in GitHub Actions environment")

    // In GitHub Actions, we expect the binary to be pre-built and symlinked by the workflow
    thinktankBinary := "thinktank"
    if runtime.GOOS == "windows" {
        thinktankBinary += ".exe"
    }

    // Get the absolute path to the existing binary
    path, err := filepath.Abs(thinktankBinary)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("FATAL: Failed to get absolute path for thinktank in GitHub Actions: %v", err)
    }

    thinktankBinaryPath = path
    fmt.Printf("Using pre-built binary at: %s\n", thinktankBinaryPath)
}
```

### 2. Modify the GitHub workflow file

Add a dedicated step to build a CI-specific binary for the correct platform:

```yaml
# Build a CI-specific binary for E2E tests to avoid cross-platform issues
- name: Build E2E test binary
  run: |
    # Determine current platform
    export GOOS=linux
    export GOARCH=amd64

    # Build a binary specifically for CI E2E tests with explicit target platform
    echo "Building binary for $GOOS/$GOARCH..."
    GOOS=$GOOS GOARCH=$GOARCH CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o thinktank-e2e ./cmd/thinktank
    chmod +x thinktank-e2e

    # Check binary details
    file thinktank-e2e
  timeout-minutes: 2

# Run E2E tests with parallel execution
- name: Run E2E tests with full coverage
  run: |
    # Create a symlink so the tests find the binary at the expected location
    ln -sf $(pwd)/thinktank-e2e $(pwd)/thinktank
    chmod +x thinktank
    ./internal/e2e/run_e2e_tests.sh --verbose
  timeout-minutes: 15
```

### 3. Add CI environment detection

```go
// isRunningInGitHubActions returns true if running in GitHub Actions
func isRunningInGitHubActions() bool {
    return os.Getenv("GITHUB_ACTIONS") == "true"
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Add runtime import to e2e_test.go
2. Set explicit GOOS and GOARCH when building the binary
3. Add CGO_ENABLED=0 to disable CGO for better compatibility
4. Add environment detection for GitHub Actions
5. Modify TestMain to use pre-built binary in CI
6. Update GitHub workflow file to build the binary with explicit platform flags
7. Push the changes to the branch
8. Monitor the CI run to ensure it passes

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
- Always set explicit target platform (GOOS, GOARCH) when building binaries
- Disable CGO for better cross-platform compatibility
- Use symlinks in CI to ensure binaries are found in expected locations
- Set explicit executable permissions (chmod +x) after building binaries
- Add code to detect CI environments and adapt behavior accordingly
- Build binaries specifically for the CI environment rather than relying on automated discovery
- Add verification steps like `file thinktank-e2e` to check binary format
- Write dedicated documentation on how E2E tests work in CI vs local development
