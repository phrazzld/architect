# GitHub Actions Workflow Validation

This document outlines the process for validating the GitHub Actions workflow syntax to ensure it will run correctly.

## Validation Methods

### Method 1: Using actionlint (Recommended)

The `actionlint` tool provides comprehensive validation for GitHub Actions workflows.

Installation:
```bash
# Using Homebrew (macOS)
brew install actionlint

# Using Go
go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest
```

Validation:
```bash
actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### Method 2: Using GitHub's Built-in Validation

When pushing a workflow file to GitHub, the system automatically validates the syntax. However, this requires a commit to the repository.

Steps:
1. Commit and push the workflow file to a feature branch
2. Go to the GitHub repository's "Actions" tab
3. If there are syntax errors, GitHub will display a warning icon and error messages

### Method 3: Using the GitHub Actions Visual Studio Code Extension

If using Visual Studio Code, the GitHub Actions extension provides real-time validation:

1. Install the "GitHub Actions" extension
2. Open the workflow file
3. Syntax errors will be highlighted directly in the editor

## Current Validation Status

The current `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file has been checked for:

1. ✅ Valid YAML syntax
2. ✅ Proper job dependencies (needs)
3. ✅ Valid action references and versions
4. ✅ Appropriate timeout settings

For comprehensive validation, it's recommended to run `actionlint` on the file before creating a test pull request.

## Common Issues to Watch For

- Action version specification (e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`)
- Indentation and YAML structure
- Job dependencies and order
- Conditional expressions
- Environment variables
- Trigger event configurations
