# Task: Replace spinner start/stop messages with logger in main.go

## Goal
Replace all `spinnerInstance.Start(msg)` and `spinnerInstance.Stop(msg)` calls with equivalent `logger.Info(msg)` calls in main.go, preserving the informational content to ensure user feedback is maintained.

## Approaches Considered

### Approach 1: Direct Replacement
Simply replace each `spinnerInstance.Start(msg)` and `spinnerInstance.Stop(msg)` with `logger.Info(msg)` at each call site, leaving surrounding code unchanged.

**Pros:**
- Simple and straightforward implementation
- Minimal code changes
- Low risk of introducing bugs

**Cons:**
- Spinner initialization code will remain until later tasks
- Keeps the spinner initialization call in place (to be removed in a future task)
- May duplicate some logging if the spinner calls already have corresponding logger calls

### Approach 2: Replacement with Initialization Code Modification
Replace each spinner method call and also modify the initialization code at the beginning of each function to remove the `spinnerInstance := initSpinner(config, logger)` calls.

**Pros:**
- More complete solution that removes more spinner-related code
- Reduces unused variables
- Cleaner intermediate state

**Cons:**
- Requires changes to multiple parts of each function
- Higher risk of introducing errors
- Crosses boundaries with a later task (removing initSpinner function)
- More complex implementation

### Approach 3: Function-by-Function Complete Replacement
For each function that uses a spinner, completely rewrite it to use only logger calls, removing all spinner code.

**Pros:**
- Most thorough approach
- Cleanest final state
- Addresses all spinner issues at once

**Cons:**
- Highest complexity and risk
- Large changes that are hard to review
- Overlaps with multiple future tasks
- Goes beyond the scope of the current task

## Chosen Implementation Approach
**Approach 1: Direct Replacement**

I'll use a direct replacement approach, focusing only on replacing the `spinnerInstance.Start(msg)` and `spinnerInstance.Stop(msg)` calls with `logger.Info(msg)` calls. This adheres to the task's specific scope while minimizing risk.

The implementation steps will be:
1. Replace all 8 `spinnerInstance.Start(...)` calls with `logger.Info(...)`
2. Replace all 9 `spinnerInstance.Stop(...)` calls with `logger.Info(...)`
3. Keep the spinnerInstance initialization as-is (to be handled in a later task)
4. Ensure dynamic messages using fmt.Sprintf are preserved

## Reasoning for Approach
I've chosen Approach 1 for several key reasons:

1. **Task Isolation**: The approach aligns perfectly with the current task's specific requirements without crossing boundaries with future tasks.

2. **Risk Minimization**: By making focused, minimal changes, we reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs.

3. **Gradual Transition**: This approach allows for a step-by-step removal of spinner functionality, making it easier to catch and fix any issues that might arise.

4. **Code Review Clarity**: Smaller, focused changes are easier to review and validate.

5. **Backward Compatibility**: If we need to revert or modify our approach, smaller incremental changes are easier to manage.

The spinner's internal implementation already has a fallback to use `logger.Info` when the spinner is disabled, so this approach is consistent with the existing pattern. Looking at the spinner.go code, we can see that replacing Start/Stop calls with logger.Info calls matches the spinner's own fallback behavior.

While Approaches 2 and 3 would provide a more complete solution, they go beyond the scope of the current task and overlap with future tasks. This could lead to confusion and potential merge conflicts in the remaining work. The chosen approach satisfies the requirements while maintaining separation of concerns across tasks.
