# Create build job

## Goal
Configure the build job in the GitHub Actions workflow with proper settings to effectively build the Go project.

## Implementation Approach
Update the build job in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file with the following improvements:

1. Configure the job to run after the test job has completed successfully
2. Keep the existing checkout and Go environment setup steps
3. Prepare the job structure for subsequent build and artifact upload steps
4. Add appropriate name and configuration

## Reasoning

1. **Job dependencies**: By making the build job run after the test job (using the `needs` parameter), we ensure that we only build the code that has passed all tests, which is more efficient and prevents wasting resources on building code with failing tests.

2. **Reuse of existing steps**: The basic steps for checking out the code and setting up the Go environment are already in place and can be kept as is. This maintains consistency with other jobs in the workflow.

3. **Preparation for future tasks**: According to the TODO.md, there are additional build-related tasks coming up ("Implement build step" and "Add artifact upload"). Setting up the proper structure now makes these future tasks easier to implement.

4. **Incremental implementation**: By focusing just on configuring the job itself (without implementing the actual build steps yet), we're following the incremental approach established in the project's task breakdown.

5. **Build environment**: Using the same `ubuntu-latest` environment as the other jobs ensures consistency in the workflow. Ubuntu is well-supported for Go builds and is a standard choice for CI environments.
