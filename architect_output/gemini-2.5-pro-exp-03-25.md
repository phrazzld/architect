## Approach 1: Direct Log Statement Enhancement

**Description:** Directly modify existing `logger.Info`, `logger.Debug`, etc., calls throughout the codebase (`app.go`, `context.go`, `fileutil.go`, etc.) to include more context (file paths, model names, progress). Add new log statements where needed.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify Log Points:** Systematically review `internal/architect/app.go`, `internal/architect/context.go`, `internal/fileutil/fileutil.go`, `internal/gemini/gemini_client.go`, `internal/architect/token.go`, `internal/architect/output.go` to find existing log statements and locations needing new ones.
2.  **Enhance Messages:** Update the format strings and arguments passed to `logger.X` methods. Include relevant variables like `modelName`, `filePath`, specific `cliConfig` settings (e.g., filters), loop counters, or counts (e.g., "file X of Y").
    *   *Example (app.go):* Change `logger.Info("Processing model: %s", modelName)` to `logger.Info("[Model: %s] Starting processing...", modelName)`. Add logs for rate limiter acquisition/release.
    *   *Example (context.go):* Add `logger.Debug("Gathering context with filters: includeExts=%v, excludeExts=%v, excludeNames=%v", config.IncludeExts, config.ExcludeExts, config.ExcludeNames)`. Change `logger.Info("Context gathered: %d files...")` to include the model name used for token counting.
    *   *Example (fileutil.go):* Enhance `Verbose` logs (which map to `Debug` or `Info` based on CLI flag) to clearly state the reason for skipping a file (e.g., `logger.Printf("Verbose: Skipping git-ignored file: %s\n", path)`). Add progress like `logger.Printf("Verbose: Processing file (%d/%d): %s\n", config.processedFiles, config.totalFiles, path)`.
    *   *Example (gemini_client.go):* Add logs at the start/end of API calls (`GenerateContent`, `CountTokens`, `GetModelInfo`), including the `modelName`.
    *   *Example (output.go):* Log the specific `outputFilePath` being written to in `saveOutputToFile`. Log start/end of `StitchPrompt`.
3.  **Add New Logs:** Insert new `logger.X` calls at the start and end of key logical blocks or operations currently lacking logging (e.g., beginning/end of `GatherContext`, `StitchPrompt`, `processModel`, API calls).
4.  **Review Levels:** Ensure INFO is used for significant milestones and summaries, while DEBUG is used for detailed step-by-step information, skipped items, or potentially large data summaries (like listing all files).

**Pros:**

*   **Simple & Direct:** Very easy to understand and implement using existing patterns. Low learning curve.
*   **Localized Changes:** While changes are across files, each change is localized to the specific operation being logged.
*   **No New Abstractions:** Leverages the existing `logutil.LoggerInterface` without adding new layers.
*   **Maximum Flexibility:** Each log message can be tailored precisely as needed.

**Cons:**

*   **Scattered Modifications:** Changes are distributed across multiple files and packages.
*   **Potential for Minor Repetition:** Might need to pass the same contextual variable (e.g., `modelName`) to multiple log calls within the same function.
*   **Manual Effort:** Requires careful identification and modification of each relevant log statement.

**Evaluation Against Standards:**

*   **`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`:**
    *   *Simplicity:* **High**. Most straightforward approach.
    *   *Modularity:* **Neutral**. Doesn't change module boundaries.
    *   *Testability:* **High**. Doesn't affect core logic testability. Log output can be tested by capturing stderr if needed, but core logic tests don't require log-related mocking.
    *   *Maintainability:* **Moderate**. Easy to understand individual changes, but they are spread out.
    *   *Explicit is Better than Implicit:* **High**. Makes logging details explicit in the message.
    *   *Automate Everything:* N/A.
    *   *Document Decisions:* N/A.
*   **`ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`:**
    *   *Unix Philosophy, Separation of Concerns, Dependency Inversion, Package Structure, API Design, Configuration Management, Error Handling:* **Neutral**. This approach doesn't significantly impact architectural aspects. Logging remains a cross-cutting concern handled via the injected logger.
*   **`CODING_STANDARDS.md`:**
    *   *Strictness, Types, Immutability, Pure Functions:* **Neutral**.
    *   *Meaningful Naming:* **High**. Applies directly to crafting clear log messages.
    *   *Formatting, Linting:* **High**. Standard Go formatting/linting applies.
    *   *Address Violations:* N/A.
    *   *Purposeful Comments:* **Neutral**.
    *   *Dependency Management:* **Neutral**. No new dependencies.
*   **`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`:**
    *   *Testability:* **High**. Adheres to the principle of minimal mocking. Core logic remains testable without needing to mock the logger itself for most tests. Integration tests can optionally capture log output.
*   **`DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`:**
    *   *Self-Documenting Code:* **Low/Neutral**. Log messages enhance operational understanding but aren't code documentation per se.
    *   *Explicit is Better than Implicit:* **High**. Aligns with the documentation principle by making runtime actions explicit.

## Approach 2: Contextual Logger Wrapper

**Description:** Introduce a lightweight wrapper around `logutil.LoggerInterface` or helper functions that automatically include common contextual information (e.g., `modelName`, current operation stage) in log messages.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify Common Context:** Determine frequently needed context (e.g., `modelName` within `processModel`, `filePath` within `fileutil`).
2.  **Create Wrapper/Helpers (in `logutil` or a new `logcontext` package):**
    *   *Option A (Wrapper):* Define `type ContextualLogger struct { baseLogger logutil.LoggerInterface; context map[string]interface{} }`. Implement `Info`, `Debug`, etc., methods that merge context with the message.
    *   *Option B (Helpers):* Define functions like `logutil.InfoWithFields(logger logutil.LoggerInterface, fields map[string]interface{}, format string, v ...interface{})`.
3.  **Instantiate/Use:** In scopes where context is available (e.g., `processModel`), create a contextual logger instance or prepare a context map.
    *   *Example (Wrapper):* `modelLogger := logutil.NewContextualLogger(logger, map[string]interface{}{"model": modelName})`
    *   *Example (Helper):* `fields := map[string]interface{}{"model": modelName}`
4.  **Refactor Log Calls:** Replace direct `logger.X` calls with `modelLogger.Info(...)` or `logutil.InfoWithFields(logger, fields, ...)` calls.
5.  **Add New Logs:** Use the wrapper/helpers for new log points.

**Pros:**

*   **DRY:** Reduces the need to manually add the same context fields (like `modelName`) repeatedly within a function scope.
*   **Consistency:** Can enforce a consistent format for adding context (e.g., always prefixing with `[Model: %s]`).
*   **Centralized Context Formatting:** Logic for how context appears in logs is centralized.

**Cons:**

*   **Added Abstraction:** Introduces a new struct or set of helper functions, adding a minor layer of complexity.
*   **Management Overhead:** Requires creating/passing the wrapper instance or context map.
*   **Potential Rigidity:** Might be slightly less flexible if a specific log message needs context formatted differently than the wrapper provides.

**Evaluation Against Standards:**

*   **`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`:**
    *   *Simplicity:* **Moderate**. Adds a small abstraction.
    *   *Modularity:* **Neutral/Slightly Positive**. Centralizes some formatting logic.
    *   *Testability:* **High**. Wrapper is simple and testable. Core logic testability unchanged. Minimal mocking.
    *   *Maintainability:* **Moderate/High**. Easier global updates to context format, but requires understanding the wrapper.
    *   *Explicit is Better than Implicit:* **Moderate/High**. Context is still explicit, potentially added automatically.
    *   *Automate Everything:* N/A.
    *   *Document Decisions:* N/A.
*   **`ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`:**
    *   **Neutral** across all guidelines. Doesn't fundamentally change architecture.
*   **`CODING_STANDARDS.md`:**
    *   **Neutral** across most standards. Promotes DRY.
*   **`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`:**
    *   *Testability:* **High**. Similar to Approach 1 regarding core logic testing. Minimal mocking needed.
*   **`DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`:**
    *   *Self-Documenting Code:* **Low/Neutral**.
    *   *Explicit is Better than Implicit:* **High**.

## Approach 3: Structured Logging with Context Fields

**Description:** Modify the `logutil.Logger` to natively support structured logging (key-value pairs). Pass context explicitly as fields at each call site. The logger formats the output (e.g., JSON, logfmt).

**Steps:**

1.  **Modify `logutil.Logger`:**
    *   Change logging methods (e.g., `Info`, `Debug`) to accept variadic key-value pairs (e.g., `Info(msg string, fields ...interface{})`) or a map (`Info(msg string, fields map[string]interface{})`).
    *   Update the internal `log` method and message formatting logic to handle these fields and output a structured format (e.g., JSON). Consider using a standard library like `log/slog` (Go 1.21+) or a third-party library internally if significant changes are needed.
2.  **Refactor Log Calls:** Update all `logger.X` calls to pass context as key-value pairs.
    *   *Example:* `logger.Info("Starting model processing", "model", modelName)`
3.  **Add New Logs:** Use the new structured format for added log points.
4.  **Choose Output Format:** Decide on JSON, logfmt, or another structured format.

**Pros:**

*   **Rich Context:** Explicitly captures context as structured data.
*   **Machine Parseable:** Ideal for log aggregation and analysis tools.
*   **Standardized:** Aligns with modern logging practices (e.g., `slog`).

**Cons:**

*   **More Invasive:** Requires significant changes to the `logutil.Logger` implementation. Might involve adopting a new logging library/pattern like `slog`.
*   **Verbose Call Sites:** Log statements become longer with explicit key-value pairs.
*   **Potential Performance Overhead:** Formatting structured logs can be slightly more resource-intensive (though often negligible).
*   **Human Readability:** Raw structured logs can be less immediately readable in the console than formatted strings.

**Evaluation Against Standards:**

*   **`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`:**
    *   *Simplicity:* **Low/Moderate**. Increases complexity of the logging system and call sites.
    *   *Modularity:* **Positive**. Enhances the logger module's capability.
    *   *Testability:* **High**. Core logic testability unchanged. Testing log output is easier (parsing JSON vs. regex). Minimal mocking.
    *   *Maintainability:* **Moderate/High**. Easier to query logs later, but requires understanding structured logging.
    *   *Explicit is Better than Implicit:* **Very High**. Context is explicit key-value data.
    *   *Automate Everything:* **Positive**. Enables better log analysis automation.
    *   *Document Decisions:* N/A.
*   **`ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`:**
    *   **Neutral** across all guidelines.
*   **`CODING_STANDARDS.md`:**
    *   **Neutral** across most standards.
*   **`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`:**
    *   *Testability:* **High**. Core logic testing remains unchanged. Minimal mocking needed.
*   **`DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`:**
    *   *Self-Documenting Code:* **Low/Neutral**.
    *   *Explicit is Better than Implicit:* **Very High**.

## Recommendation

**Recommended Approach:** **Approach 1: Direct Log Statement Enhancement**

**Justification:**

1.  **Simplicity/Clarity (`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`):** Approach 1 is the simplest and most direct way to fulfill the task requirements. It involves familiar patterns (`Printf`-style logging) and avoids introducing new abstractions (Approach 2) or significantly overhauling the logging system (Approach 3). This aligns best with the "Simplicity First" principle.
2.  **Separation of Concerns (`ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`):** All approaches maintain the separation, as logging is handled via the injected `LoggerInterface`. Approach 1 makes the fewest assumptions about how logging should be structured beyond simple messages.
3.  **Testability (Minimal Mocking) (`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`):** All approaches score highly here. Approach 1 requires the least change to the existing codebase and testing setup, making it the lowest risk. Core application logic remains highly testable without complex mocking related to the logging enhancements.
4.  **Coding Conventions (`CODING_STANDARDS.md`):** Approach 1 uses standard Go formatting verbs within log messages, fitting existing conventions.
5.  **Documentability (`DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`):** By making log messages more explicit and informative, Approach 1 directly improves the runtime "documentation" of the application's behavior, aligning with the "Explicit is Better than Implicit" documentation principle.

**Rationale Comparison & Trade-offs:**

*   **Approach 1 vs. Approach 2:** While Approach 2 offers DRY benefits by reducing context repetition (e.g., `modelName`), the current codebase structure doesn't exhibit excessive repetition that would strongly justify the added abstraction of a wrapper or helpers. The simplicity of Approach 1 outweighs the minor potential for repetition at this stage.
*   **Approach 1 vs. Approach 3:** Approach 3 (Structured Logging) is a significant step towards machine-parseable logs, which is valuable but overkill for the current requirement of enhancing human-readable clarity and verbosity. It introduces considerable complexity compared to Approach 1. If structured logging becomes a future requirement for integration with log analysis platforms, it should be tackled as a separate, dedicated task, potentially migrating `logutil` to use Go's standard `slog` package.

**Conclusion:** Approach 1 delivers the required enhancements to logging verbosity and clarity with the least complexity, adhering best to the project's standards hierarchy, particularly Simplicity and Testability. It directly addresses the acceptance criteria without over-engineering the solution.
