# Add context gathering logging

## Task Goal
Add structured audit logging to the context gathering process, capturing details about files processed, counts, and statistics to provide better operational visibility.

## Implementation Approach
The implementation will add audit logging events at key points in the context gathering process:

1. Add logging at the start and end of the context gathering process
2. Log statistics about the number of files found, processed, and skipped
3. Log any errors encountered during context gathering
4. Add metadata to events with relevant file counts and timing information

This approach will involve:
- Identifying the main entry points for context gathering in the codebase
- Adding audit logging calls at appropriate points in the workflow
- Ensuring backward compatibility with code that doesn't provide an audit logger
- Adding appropriate nil checks to prevent panics
- Capturing meaningful statistics that would help with debugging and monitoring

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Minimal Logging (Start/End Only)
Only log the beginning and end of the context gathering process without detailed statistics.
- Pros: Simpler implementation, less overhead
- Cons: Lacks detailed information for debugging or monitoring usage patterns

### Alternative 2: Comprehensive Per-File Logging
Log details about each individual file processed during context gathering.
- Pros: Maximum visibility into the process
- Cons: Excessive log volume, potential performance impact, log noise for large codebases

## Reasoning for Chosen Approach
The selected approach balances detailed operational visibility with reasonable log volume. By logging aggregate statistics rather than per-file details, we provide useful information for monitoring and debugging without overwhelming the log file or significantly impacting performance. This approach aligns with the existing audit logging pattern established in previously completed tasks.
