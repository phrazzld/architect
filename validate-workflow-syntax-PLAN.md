# Validate workflow syntax

## Goal
Validate the syntax of the GitHub Actions workflow file to ensure it's correctly formatted and will run without errors.

## Implementation Approach
There are two main approaches to validating the workflow file syntax:

1. Use the GitHub Actions linter via the `actionlint` tool, which can be installed and run locally
2. Validate by pushing the workflow file to a special branch and checking that GitHub's own validation doesn't report errors

For this task, we'll implement option 1 as it provides immediate feedback without requiring pushing to the repository:

1. Install the `actionlint` tool locally
2. Run the linter against the workflow file
3. Address any issues identified
4. Document the validation process

## Reasoning

1. **Local validation**: Using a local linter like `actionlint` allows us to catch syntax errors before pushing to the repository, which is more efficient than trial-and-error commits.

2. **Comprehensive validation**: `actionlint` is more thorough than GitHub's basic syntax validation and can identify issues with action versions, incorrect event triggers, and other common mistakes.

3. **No repository modification**: This approach doesn't require making commits to the repository just for validation purposes, keeping the git history clean.

4. **Industry standard**: `actionlint` is a widely-used tool for validating GitHub Actions workflows and is recommended by GitHub themselves for local validation.
