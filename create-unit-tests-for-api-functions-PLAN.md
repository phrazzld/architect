# Implementation Plan: Create unit tests for API functions

## Task Goal
Create comprehensive unit tests for the API functions in api.go to verify their behavior in isolation.

## Chosen Approach
**Table-Driven Tests for Enhanced Readability**

This approach will use standard Go testing patterns with table-driven tests to enhance readability and maintainability. The key aspects include:

1. Treating the `apiService` struct as the primary unit under test
2. Using table-driven tests to organize multiple test cases for functions with various conditions
3. Focusing on testing the behavior of each method (inputs and outputs)
4. Minimizing mocking to only essential external dependencies (logger)
5. Creating appropriate test fixtures directly instead of using complex mocks

## Reasoning for Choice
I chose the table-driven tests approach for the following reasons:

1. **Testability**: The current codebase design with interfaces and error types is already highly testable.

2. **Alignment with Testing Philosophy**:
   - Tests will focus on **behavior**, not implementation details
   - Minimal mocking is required - only the logger interface needs a mock
   - Tests will remain simple and readable using table-driven organization
   - Both happy paths and edge cases will be thoroughly covered

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Table-driven tests make it easy to add or modify test cases
   - Test structure clearly maps inputs to expected outputs and error conditions
   - The approach reduces code duplication across test cases

4. **Practicality**:
   - Uses standard Go testing library without external dependencies
   - Works well with the error types and patterns in the existing code
   - Can verify both error types and error message contents

## Implementation Steps

1. Complete the `TestNewAPIService` function to verify the service is properly created

2. Enhance `TestAPIServiceImplementation` for the `InitClient` method:
   - Retain existing test cases for parameter validation
   - Add tests for API error handling using the gemini.APIError type
   - Add a table-driven structure to organize test cases

3. Complete the `TestProcessResponse` function:
   - Retain existing test cases for different response scenarios
   - Structure tests as table-driven tests for better organization
   - Ensure error types and messages are properly verified

4. Complete the `TestErrorHelperMethods` function:
   - Organize as table-driven tests
   - Test all error helper methods with various error inputs
   - Verify correct behavior for wrapped errors

5. Add tests for any untested edge cases or error conditions

This approach builds upon the existing test structure in api_test.go while enhancing it with table-driven organization for better maintainability and readability.
