# Implement vet check

## Goal
Add a step to the GitHub Actions workflow that performs static analysis of Go code using the `go vet` tool to detect potential issues.

## Implementation Approach
Update the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to add a new step in the lint job after the formatting check step:

1. Add a clearly named step for the `go vet` check
2. Use the `run` directive to execute the `go vet ./...` command
3. Ensure the step is placed in a logical order in the workflow (after formatting check)

## Reasoning

1. **Simple command execution**: Unlike the formatting check, `go vet` already provides a non-zero exit code if it finds issues, so we can use a simple command execution rather than a shell script with conditional logic.

2. **Full package scanning**: Using `go vet ./...` ensures that all packages in the project are analyzed, which is appropriate for CI workflows as we want comprehensive analysis.

3. **Placement in the workflow**: The `go vet` check is a more advanced analysis than formatting checks but less comprehensive than golangci-lint, so placing it between these two steps is logical.

4. **Importance in Go development**: `go vet` is a standard tool in the Go ecosystem and is considered essential for catching common mistakes in Go code, making it a valuable addition to the CI pipeline.
