# T001: Create registry_api_test.go file with test harness

## Overview
The task is to create a test harness for the `registry_api.go` file that enables thorough testing of its functionality. This is the first step in addressing the test coverage issues identified in the dead code elimination PR.

## Analysis
After examining `registry_api.go`, I've identified that it implements a critical API service interface using the Registry pattern. The file has several methods with 0% test coverage that need to be properly tested to restore overall coverage.

## Key Components to Test
1. `registryAPIService` struct implementation
2. Methods interacting with Registry and Provider interfaces
3. Error handling paths
4. Environment variable and configuration handling
5. Model parameter validation logic

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Mock Dependencies
I need to create mock implementations for:
- `registry.Registry` interface
- `providers.Provider` interface
- Any other dependencies like loggers (can use existing mocks)

### 2. Basic Test Structure
The test file will use:
- Table-driven tests for each method
- Separate sub-tests for success and failure paths
- Environment setup and teardown for API key tests

### 3. Test Harness Implementation
- Create a test suite setup function
- Implement helper functions for common test operations
- Setup environment variable management for tests

### 4. Specific Test Cases
Focus on testing:
- Constructor function
- Client initialization logic
- Model parameter handling
- Error detection and classification
- Environment variable resolution

## Dependencies
- Understanding of Go testing patterns
- Knowledge of the Registry interface and its contracts
- Access to existing mock implementations in the codebase
- Familiarity with table-driven testing

## Success Criteria
- Test file successfully compiles and runs
- Test harness provides the foundation for all subsequent Registry API tests
- Clear patterns established for mocking the Registry and Provider interfaces
- Environment variable management properly handled

## Implementation Notes
I've created a minimal test harness for the registry API service. I've set up mock implementations for the dependencies and wrote basic tests for:

1. `TestProcessLLMResponse` - Verifies the error handling for nil, empty, safety-blocked, and whitespace-only responses
2. `TestErrorClassificationMethods` - Tests the error classification methods (IsEmptyResponseError, IsSafetyBlockedError)
3. `TestGetModelParameters` - Tests parameter retrieval from the registry

I encountered quite a few challenges adapting the code to work with the mock registry implementation. This PR will require more extensive changes to the registry_api.go file to make it more testable. The current approach of using concrete types rather than interfaces makes it difficult to mock.

For future tickets, I recommend refactoring the registry_api.go file to use interfaces instead of concrete types to make it more testable. This would be a separate ticket since it requires architectural changes.

## Next Steps
The next tasks would be to implement tests for the remaining methods of the registry API service, following the patterns established in this PR. However, this may require a refactoring of the registry_api.go file to make it more testable.
