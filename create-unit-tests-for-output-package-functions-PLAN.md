# Create unit tests for output package functions

## Task Goal
Create comprehensive unit tests for the output.go functions to ensure proper file writing and plan generation functionality.

## Implementation Approach

### Selected Approach: Behavior-Based Testing with Mocks
1. Create tests for all public methods of the OutputWriter interface:
   - SaveToFile
   - GenerateAndSavePlan
   - GenerateAndSavePlanWithConfig
2. Use mocks for all external dependencies:
   - TokenManager
   - APIService
   - Gemini Client
   - Prompt Manager
   - Config Manager
3. Test each method's core behavior:
   - Verify files are created with correct content
   - Verify error handling paths
   - Ensure dependencies are properly utilized

This approach focuses on testing the behavior of the functions rather than implementation details, ensuring the output package works correctly without being brittle to refactoring.

### Alternative Approaches Considered:

#### Alternative 1: Integration Testing Approach
- Create tests that use real dependencies
- Test end-to-end functionality with minimal mocking
- Verify output files are created with realistic inputs

**Rejected because:** Integration tests would be more complex to set up and maintain. Using real dependencies would make tests slower and potentially less reliable due to external factors. Integration-style tests are valuable but should be part of a separate testing strategy.

#### Alternative 2: Implementation-Detail Testing
- Create tests that verify internal function calls and sequences
- Test private functions directly
- Focus on ensuring implementation correctness

**Rejected because:** Testing implementation details creates brittle tests that break when refactoring occurs. This violates the "test behavior, not implementation" principle mentioned in the project's testing philosophy.

## Implementation Reasoning
The selected approach balances thorough testing with maintainability:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all public methods to ensure the entire interface behaves correctly
2. **Isolation**: Uses mocks to isolate the code under test from its dependencies
3. **Maintainability**: Tests behavior rather than implementation, making tests resistant to refactoring
4. **Simplicity**: Focuses on key behaviors without over-testing implementation details
5. **Alignment with Project**: Follows the project's existing testing patterns and philosophy

By ensuring the output package has thorough tests, we'll have better confidence in its functionality and make future changes safer and easier.
