# Refactor Transitional main_test.go - Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Analysis of Test Coverage**
   - Identified tests in component packages (`cmd/architect/cli_test.go`, `cmd/architect/prompt_test.go`) that already cover the functionality tested in the transitional files
   - Confirmed that integration tests in `internal/integration/integration_test.go` cover high-level application behavior

2. **Removed Obsolete Test Files**
   - `main_test.go` - Main transitional file that re-exported functions and types
   - `main_examples_test.go` - Tests for example templates and flag parsing
   - `main_validate_inputs_test.go` - Tests for input validation logic
   - `main_task_file_test.go` - Tests for task file requirements
   - `main_flags_test.go` - Tests for CLI flags parsing
   - `main_integration_test.go` - Integration tests now covered in the dedicated integration package
   - `main_task_file_error_test.go` - Tests for task file error handling

3. **Verification**
   - Ran the test suite and confirmed all tests pass after removing the obsolete files
   - Ran `go fmt` and `go vet` to ensure code quality

## Benefits

- **Simplified Test Structure**: Removed redundant tests that were duplicating functionality already tested in component packages
- **Reduced Maintenance Burden**: Eliminated the need to maintain transitional code that bridges old and new architectures
- **Improved Code Organization**: Tests are now located with the components they're testing, following Go best practices
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Integration tests are properly located in the integration package, while component tests are in their respective component packages

## Remaining Work (for future PRs)

- **Fix Template Tests**: The template-related tests in `cmd/architect/prompt_test.go` are currently skipped with a FIXME comment. These need to be fixed in a separate PR focused on template path resolution.
- **Coverage Improvement**: Some components may benefit from additional tests to improve coverage, though this was not part of the current refactoring effort.

## Conclusion

This refactoring successfully completed the transition to the new component-based architecture by removing the transitional test files that were bridging old and new implementations. The codebase is now cleaner, better organized, and follows Go best practices more closely.
