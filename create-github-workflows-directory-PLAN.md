# Create GitHub workflows directory

## Goal
Create the `.github/workflows` directory in the repository root to prepare for implementing GitHub Actions workflows.

## Implementation Approach
Use the `mkdir -p` command to create the directory structure. The `-p` flag will create parent directories as needed, which is useful since we need to create both `.github` and its subdirectory `workflows`.

## Reasoning
1. Using `mkdir -p` is the most straightforward and reliable approach to create nested directories.
2. This approach works regardless of whether the `.github` directory already exists or not.
3. It's a standard practice for setting up GitHub Actions directories in repositories.
