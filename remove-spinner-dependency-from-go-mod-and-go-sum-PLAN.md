# Remove spinner dependency from go.mod and go.sum

## Task Goal
Remove the dependency on `github.com/briandowns/spinner` from the project's go.mod and go.sum files, since the spinner functionality has been completely removed from the codebase and replaced with logging-based feedback.

## Implementation Approach
I will use a simple and straightforward approach:

1. Verify that the spinner code has been completely removed from the codebase
2. Run `go mod tidy` to automatically clean up unused dependencies
3. Verify that the spinner dependency has been removed from go.mod and go.sum
4. Run tests to ensure everything still works correctly

This approach leverages Go's built-in dependency management to automatically detect and remove unused dependencies, which is an officially recommended practice.

## Reasoning for Selected Approach
I considered three potential approaches:

1. **Manual Editing**: Directly edit the go.mod and go.sum files to remove the spinner-related entries. This is error-prone and not recommended as it could lead to inconsistencies between the files.

2. **Use go mod tidy (Selected)**: Let Go's dependency management system handle the removal. This is the safest and most reliable approach, as it ensures that the go.mod and go.sum files remain consistent.

3. **Full Dependency Rebuild**: Run `go mod init` followed by re-adding all required dependencies. This is more disruptive and could potentially introduce unexpected changes.

I've chosen the second option because:

1. It follows Go's official best practices for dependency management
2. It's the safest approach, reducing the risk of manually introducing errors
3. It's efficient and requires minimal effort
4. It automatically handles related indirect dependencies that might be affected
5. It ensures consistency between go.mod and go.sum files

This approach is particularly appropriate since we've already completed all the code changes required to remove spinner usage, so there should be no remaining imports of the spinner package in the codebase.
