# Configure Go environment setup

## Goal
Add steps to set up the Go environment with version caching using the actions/setup-go@v5 GitHub Action across all jobs in the workflow.

## Implementation Approach
Update the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to:

1. Replace the placeholder Go setup step in the lint job with a proper implementation using actions/setup-go@v5
2. Add the same Go setup step to the test and build jobs for consistency
3. Configure the action to:
   - Use the stable version of Go as specified in the PLAN.md
   - Enable caching to speed up subsequent runs
   - Add cache for Go modules to improve workflow performance

## Reasoning

1. **Consistent setup across jobs**: Adding the Go setup step to all jobs ensures each job has the same Go environment. This approach provides consistency and prevents potential issues from different Go versions being used in different jobs.

2. **Version specification**: Using 'stable' as the Go version matches the requirements in the PLAN.md and provides a good balance between stability and using recent features. The alternative would be to pin a specific version, but 'stable' will automatically use the latest stable Go release, which is typically preferred for CI environments.

3. **Performance optimization**: Enabling caching for both the Go environment and Go modules will significantly improve workflow performance on subsequent runs, reducing CI execution time.

4. **Using the latest action version**: Using v5 of the actions/setup-go action (as specified in the task) ensures access to the latest features and improvements.
