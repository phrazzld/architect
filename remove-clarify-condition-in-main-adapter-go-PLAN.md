# Remove clarify condition in main_adapter.go

## Goal
Delete the if block that calls simulateClarifyTaskDescription in internal/integration/main_adapter.go.

## Implementation Approach
Looking at the current code in `internal/integration/main_adapter.go`, I can see that the clarify condition has already been removed and replaced with a comment:

```go
// Task clarification code has been removed
```

This is located on line 113, where the if block would have been. The task to remove the simulateClarifyTaskDescription function has already been completed, and as part of that task, the if block that called it was also removed.

## Reasoning
The task is actually already complete. During the previous task of removing the simulateClarifyTaskDescription function, the if block that called it was also removed and replaced with the comment. This was done because it makes sense to remove both the function and its call site together to maintain code consistency and avoid compilation errors.

Therefore, this task is already complete and we simply need to mark it as such in the TODO.md file.
