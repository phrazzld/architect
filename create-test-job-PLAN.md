# Create test job

## Goal
Configure the test job in the GitHub Actions workflow with proper settings to effectively run tests for the Go project.

## Implementation Approach
Update the test job in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file with the following improvements:

1. Ensure the job has a descriptive name and runs on the latest Ubuntu runner
2. Keep the checkout and Go environment setup steps that are already in place
3. Add a proper test step that runs the tests using `go test ./...`
4. Configure appropriate settings like timeouts and test output formatting
5. Make sure the test job runs after the lint job to ensure code quality checks pass first

## Reasoning

1. **Basic test execution**: The `go test ./...` command is the standard way to run all tests in a Go project. This command will find and execute all test files in the repository and its subdirectories.

2. **Job dependencies**: By making the test job run after the lint job (using the `needs` parameter), we ensure that the code meets quality standards before spending resources on running tests. This is an efficient approach for the CI pipeline.

3. **Simple initial configuration**: For this task, we'll focus on a basic but solid test configuration. More advanced testing features like race detection and coverage reporting will be implemented in subsequent tasks, as indicated in the TODO.md file.

4. **Best practices**: Following Go testing best practices by ensuring the test job has appropriate verbosity and clear failure messaging helps developers quickly identify and fix issues.
