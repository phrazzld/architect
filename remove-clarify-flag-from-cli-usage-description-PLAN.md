# Remove clarify flag from CLI usage description

## Goal
Remove the `--clarify` flag description from the CLI usage help text to ensure that users no longer see this deprecated feature as an available option.

## Implementation Approach
1. Locate the `flagSet.Usage` function in `cmd/architect/cli.go`
2. Identify and remove any text describing the `--clarify` flag in the usage description
3. Ensure the formatting and structure of the remaining usage text remains consistent

## Reasoning
This is a straightforward removal task that follows the dependency on removing the flag definition itself. The flag definition has already been removed, so it's important that the user-facing documentation in the CLI help text is also updated to prevent confusion. This approach directly targets the specific help text without impacting any functionality, as the flag has already been functionally removed in previous tasks.

Since this is purely a documentation update within the code, there are no reasonable alternative approaches to consider beyond simply removing the relevant text while preserving formatting consistency.
