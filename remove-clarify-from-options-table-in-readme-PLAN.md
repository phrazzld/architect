# Remove clarify from options table in README

## Goal
Remove the `--clarify` flag entry from the Configuration Options table in the README.md file to ensure the documentation accurately reflects the current capabilities of the application after the removal of the clarify feature.

## Implementation Approach
1. Locate the Configuration Options table in the README.md file around line 115
2. Find and remove the row that describes the `--clarify` flag
3. Ensure that the table formatting remains consistent after the removal
4. Verify that the removal doesn't disrupt the overall structure of the documentation

## Reasoning
This straightforward approach directly addresses the task by removing the reference to the clarify flag from the Configuration Options table. This ensures that users aren't misled about available options after the feature has been removed from the codebase.

The main consideration with this approach is maintaining the correct Markdown table formatting after removing a row. Markdown tables can be sensitive to formatting, so care must be taken to ensure that the table structure remains intact.

There aren't many viable alternative approaches for this task since we need to completely remove references to the clarify flag from the documentation. The only variation would be in how carefully we handle the table formatting:

1. **Simple line deletion**: Just remove the line containing the `--clarify` information.
2. **Table regeneration**: Regenerate the entire table to ensure proper formatting.

The chosen approach (simple line deletion) is adequate since Markdown tables should remain properly formatted after removing a row, as long as the table header and separator rows are maintained.
