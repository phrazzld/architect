# Implementation Plan: Review existing cmd/architect/ implementation

## Task
Thoroughly analyze the existing cmd/architect/main.go and cmd/architect/cli.go to understand current functionality and integration points.

## Goal
Develop a clear understanding of the existing code structure, components, and relationships in the cmd/architect/ directory to guide the upcoming refactoring work where functionality from the original main.go will be moved into the specialized files (api.go, context.go, token.go, output.go, prompt.go).

## Chosen Approach: Structural and Dependency Analysis with Selective Functional Walkthrough

I'll implement a hybrid approach that primarily focuses on structural and dependency analysis of the cmd/architect/ code, supplemented with targeted execution flow tracing and selective comparison with the original main.go. This approach will:

1. Analyze the structure and dependencies of both files
2. Identify public interfaces, component relationships, and dependency flow
3. Map key execution paths to understand the orchestration logic
4. Create a reference document that outlines component responsibilities, interfaces, and integration points

## Reasoning for this Choice

I've chosen this approach primarily because:

1. **Architectural Focus**: The overall goal is architectural refactoring into components. This approach directly analyzes the existing component structure and dependencies, providing the clearest picture of how the new system is intended to work.

2. **Testability Alignment**: It emphasizes interfaces, adapters, and component boundaries, which aligns perfectly with the project's "Behavior Over Implementation" and "Minimize Mocking" testing principles. Understanding these boundaries is crucial for maintaining testability throughout the refactoring.

3. **Future Integration**: This approach provides the most direct insight into how the newly created files (api.go, context.go, etc.) should integrate with the existing architecture, ensuring consistency in the refactoring.

4. **Practical Balance**: By supplementing with selective execution flow analysis, we still gain an understanding of the functional aspects while keeping the primary focus on structure and relationships.

## Implementation Details

The analysis will be structured into the following sections:

### 1. Structure and Component Analysis
- Identify all public functions and their responsibilities
- Document primary data structures (CliConfig, etc.)
- List direct dependencies (imports and package usage)
- Map out component instantiation and relationships

### 2. Interface and Abstraction Analysis
- Identify key interfaces being used across the codebase
- Document how these interfaces promote testability
- Analyze adapter patterns for external dependencies

### 3. Execution Flow Analysis
- Trace the Main function's execution path
- Understand the role of OriginalMain as a transitional bridge
- Map how configuration flows through the system

### 4. Component Responsibility Mapping
- Create a clear mapping of responsibilities already implemented
- Identify which components from the original main.go are already refactored
- Document integration points for the upcoming refactored components

### 5. Document Findings
- Create a reference document for use in subsequent refactoring tasks
- Include a dependency graph showing relationships between components
- Highlight testing implications based on the current structure

This comprehensive analysis will provide a clear foundation for the subsequent refactoring tasks, ensuring that new components integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture while maintaining testability and separation of concerns.
