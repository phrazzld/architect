# Add unit tests for task file requirement - DONE

- Created unit tests for task file requirement
- Refactored validateInputs to extract validation logic to doValidateInputs function
- Added TestTaskFileRequirementSimple in main_task_file_test.go
- The test verifies three scenarios:
  1. Validating with a valid task file
  2. Validating with no task file (should fail)
  3. Validating with no task file but in dry run mode (should pass)
- Made functions testable without complex mocking
- All tests are now passing
