# Add Context Gathering Logging - Implementation Summary

## Task Completed
I have successfully implemented structured audit logging for the context gathering process, providing detailed visibility into file processing statistics and results.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Function for Audit Logging
- Created `GatherProjectContextWithAuditLogging` in `internal/fileutil/fileutil.go`
- Maintained backward compatibility by modifying the original function to call the new one with a nil logger
- Added proper nil checks and error handling for robustness

### 2. Logging Added at Key Points
- Beginning of context gathering process
- During file processing errors
- At completion with statistics
- Detailed metadata includes:
  - File counts (processed, skipped, total)
  - Processing duration
  - Character count
  - Error details when applicable

### 3. Main.go Integration
- Updated the call in main.go's `gatherContext` function to use the new audit logging function
- Passed the existing auditLogger that was already available in the function scope

### 4. Error Handling
- Added collection and aggregation of processing errors for better reporting
- Limited the number of errors logged to prevent excessively large log entries
- Used proper error types for structured logging

## Benefits
This implementation enables:
1. Better visibility into the context gathering process
2. Metrics for monitoring and performance analysis
3. Detailed error information for debugging
4. Statistics for usage patterns and optimization opportunities

## Testing
The implementation was verified by running the existing GatherProjectContext tests, which continue to pass. The original functionality remains unchanged while the new logging capability has been added.

## Next Steps
The next logical task would be "Add token counting operation logging" since it builds on the same structured logging foundation that has been established.
